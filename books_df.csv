"L0rrrfE0bOsC","Deep Web Query Interface Understanding and Integration","Eduard C. Dragut, Weiyi Meng, Clement T. Yu","Morgan & Claypool Publishers","2012","There are millions of searchable data sources on the Web and to a large extent their contents can only be reached through their own query interfaces. There is an enormous interest in making the data in these sources easily accessible. There are primarily two general approaches to achieve this objective. The first is to surface the contents of these sources from the deep Web and add the contents to the index of regular search engines. The second is to integrate the searching capabilities of these sources and support integrated access to them. In this book, we introduce the state-of-the-art techniques for extracting, understanding, and integrating the query interfaces of deep Web data sources. These techniques are critical for producing an integrated query interface for each domain. The interface serves as the mediator for searching all data sources in the concerned domain. While query interface integration is only relevant for the deep Web integration approach, the extraction and understanding of query interfaces are critical for both deep Web exploration approaches. This book aims to provide in-depth and comprehensive coverage of the key technologies needed to create high quality integrated query interfaces automatically. The following technical issues are discussed in detail in this book: query interface modeling, query interface extraction, query interface clustering, query interface matching, query interface attribute integration, and query interface integration.

This invaluable guide provides step-by-step instructions for investigating Internet crimes, including locating, interpreting, understanding, collecting, and documenting online electronic evidence to benefit investigations. Cybercrime is the fastest growing area of crime as more criminals seek to exploit the speed, convenience and anonymity that the Internet provides to commit a diverse range of criminal activities. Today's online crime includes attacks against computer data and systems, identity theft, distribution of child pornography, penetration of online financial services, using social networks to commit crimes, and the deployment of viruses, botnets, and email scams such as phishing. Symantec's 2012 Norton Cybercrime Report stated that the world spent an estimated $110 billion to combat cybercrime, an average of nearly $200 per victim.

"6nWzEAAAQBAJ","Plug-and-Play Visual Subgraph Query Interfaces","Sourav S. Bhowmick, Byron Choi","Springer Nature","4/17/23","This book details recent developments in the emerging area of plug-and-play (PnP) visual subgraph query interfaces (VQI). These PnP interfaces are grounded in the principles of human-computer interaction (HCI) and cognitive psychology to address long-standing limitations to bottom-up search capabilities in graph databases using traditional graph query languages, which often require domain experts and specialist programmers. This book explains how PnP interfaces go against the traditional mantra of VQI construction by taking a data-driven approach and giving end users the freedom to easily and quickly construct and maintain a VQI for any data sources without resorting to coding. The book walks readers through the intuitive PnP interface that uses templates where the underlying graph repository represents the socket and user-specified requirements represent the plug. Hence, a PnP interface enables an end user to change the socket (i.e., graph repository) or the plug (i.e., requirements) as necessary to automatically and effortlessly generate VQIs. The book argues that such a data-driven paradigm creates several benefits, including superior support for visual subgraph query construction, significant reduction in the manual cost of constructing and maintaining a VQI for any graph data source, and portability of the interface across diverse sources and querying applications. This book provides a comprehensive introduction to the notion of PnP interfaces, compares it to its classical manual counterpart, and reviews techniques for automatic construction and maintenance of these new interfaces. In synthesizing current research on plug-and-play visual subgraph query interface management, this book gives readers a snapshot of the state of the art in this topic as well as future research directions.",182,"Computers","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6nWzEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6nWzEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=6nWzEAAAQBAJ&pg=PR7&dq=search+terms&hl=&cd=17&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6nWzEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","",NA,0

Then try this super-duper colossal collection of 365 searches—a full year’s worth of mind-melting puzzles that will (as a bonus) improve your vocabulary, too.

See how many ""Movie Stars"" (Damon, Diesel, Streep) catch your eye or fun ""Onomatopoeia"" words you can circle—boom, buzz, clang, click, gurgle, hiccup, honk. Experts who want something really challenging will find what they want here, too. ""Conifer"" includes such tree names as bristlecone, loblolly, and tamarack, while ""Quantum Mechanics"" offers bosons, fermions, and isobar. And for something a little unusual, there’s even a ""Minnesota Zip Code"" puzzle, where you look for groups of numbers.

It tells the story of the impact of one of the most significant technological breakthroughs in Japan in the latter part of this century: the invention and rapid adoption of word-processing technology capable of handling Japanese script in a society where the nature of that script had previously mandated handwriting as the norm. The ramifications of this technology in both the business and personal spheres have been wide-ranging, extending from changes to business practices, work profiles, orthography and social attitudes to writing through to Japan's ability to construct a substantial presence on the Internet in recent years.",219,"Social Science","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SYEnAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SYEnAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=SYEnAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA78&dq=search+terms&hl=&cd=25&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SYEnAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","Kanji and the Keyboard",NA,0
"VQSikiO8IA0C","Data Dissemination and Query in Mobile Social Networks","Jiming Chen, Jialu Fan, Youxian Sun","Springer Science & Business Media","3/27/12","With the increasing popularization of personal hand-held mobile devices, more people use them to establish network connectivity and to query and share data among themselves in the absence of network infrastructure, creating mobile social networks (MSNet). Since users are only intermittently connected to MSNets, user mobility should be exploited to bridge network partitions and forward data. Currently, data route/forward approaches for such intermittently connected networks are commonly ""store-carry-and-forward"" schemes, which exploit the physical user movements to carry data around the network and overcome path disconnection. And since the source and destination may be far away from each other, the delay for the destination to receive the data from the source may be long. MSNets can be viewed as one type of socially-aware delay tolerant networks (DTNs). Observed from social networks, the contact frequencies are probably different between two friends and two strangers, and this difference should be taken into consideration when designing data dissemination and query schemes in MSNets. In this book, the fundamental concepts of MSNets are introduced including the background, key features and potential applications of MSNets, while also presenting research topics, such as, MSNets as realistic social contact traces and user mobility models. Because the ultimate goal is to establish networks that allow mobile users to quickly and efficiently access interesting information, particular attention is paid to data dissemination and query schemes in subsequent sections. Combined with geography information, the concepts of community and centrality are employed from a social network perspective to propose several data dissemination and query schemes, and further use real social contact traces to evaluate their performance, demonstrating that such schemes achieve better performance when exploiting more social relationships between users.",86,"Computers","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VQSikiO8IA0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VQSikiO8IA0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=VQSikiO8IA0C&pg=PA75&dq=search+terms&hl=&cd=26&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VQSikiO8IA0C&source=gbs_api","",NA,0

"BcAdAAAAQBAJ","Oxford Handbook of Internet Psychology","Adam Joinson, Katelyn McKenna, Tom Postmes, Ulf-Dietrich Reips","OUP Oxford","2/12/09","Over one billion people use the Internet globally. Psychologists are beginning to understand what people do online, and the impact being online has on behaviour. It's making us re-think many of our existing assumptions about what it means to be a social being. For instance, if we can talk, flirt, meet people and fall in love online, this challenges many of psychology's theories that intimacy or understanding requires physical co-presence. ""The Oxford Handbook of Internet Psychology"" brings together many of the leading researchers in what can be termed 'Internet Psychology'. Though a very new area of research, it is growing at a phenomenal pace. In addition to well-studied areas of investigation, such as social identity theory, computer-mediated communication and virtual communities, the volume also includes chapters on topics as diverse as deception and misrepresentation, attitude change and persuasion online, Internet addiction, online relationships, privacy and trust, health and leisure use of the Internet, and the nature of interactivity. With over 30 chapters written by experts in the field, the range and depth of coverage is unequalled, and serves to define this emerging area of research. Uniquely, this content is supported by an entire section covering the use of the Internet as a research tool, including qualitative and quantitative methods, online survey design, personality testing, ethics, and technological and design issues. While it is likely to be a popular research resource to be 'dipped into', as a whole volume it is coherent and compelling enough to act as a single text book. ""The Oxford Handbook of Internet Psychology"" is the definitive text on this burgeoning field. It will be an essential resource for anyone interested in the psychological aspects of Internet use, or planning to conduct research using the 'net'.",520,"Psychology","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BcAdAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BcAdAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=BcAdAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT508&dq=search+terms&hl=&cd=32&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BcAdAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","",NA,0

The thesis is divided into six parts, starting with a brief description of the research topic, including the problem position and objective. Second, a literature review is conducted to summarize the state of research, including theoretical foundations. In today's scientific literature the two fields of research BMI & OR are by no means treated independently from each other. For the time being BMI and OR are considered independently of each other. It is then shown exactly how current literature treats managerial OR with respect to BMI. The results are then synthesized into a summary, highlighting what is known and not known. The areas of controversy in the literature are identified and questions are formulated that need further research. The third part of the thesis consists of expert interviews. Derived from the literature review, a guideline for interviews is developed to treat the research gaps in an appropriate way and to meet the complexity of the task setting. The explorative survey aims to identify the challenges and drivers of managerial OR in BMI and to identify approaches that have not yet been addressed in scientific literature to a significant extent. The core of the analysis is the splitting of the BM into the elements value proposition, value creation, and value capture. This ensures that all the facets of a company ́s BM are accurately addressed and form the basis for high-quality results. In order to cover a broad range, the paper does not focus on a certain industry. The interviews are conducted with an array of decision-makers in organizations that have attempted or are currently attempting to innovate their BM at the business unit level or the corporate level.

"UYdyEAAAQBAJ","Query Processing over Incomplete Databases","Yunjun Gao, Xiaoye Miao","Springer Nature","6/1/22","Incomplete data is part of life and almost all areas of scientific studies. Users tend to skip certain fields when they fill out online forms; participants choose to ignore sensitive questions on surveys; sensors fail, resulting in the loss of certain readings; publicly viewable satellite map services have missing data in many mobile applications; and in privacy-preserving applications, the data is incomplete deliberately in order to preserve the sensitivity of some attribute values. Query processing is a fundamental problem in computer science, and is useful in a variety of applications. In this book, we mostly focus on the query processing over incomplete databases, which involves finding a set of qualified objects from a specified incomplete dataset in order to support a wide spectrum of real-life applications. We first elaborate the three general kinds of methods of handling incomplete data, including (i) discarding the data with missing values, (ii) imputation for the missing values, and (iii) just depending on the observed data values. For the third method type, we introduce the semantics of k-nearest neighbor (kNN) search, skyline query, and top-k dominating query on incomplete data, respectively. In terms of the three representative queries over incomplete data, we investigate some advanced techniques to process incomplete data queries, including indexing, pruning as well as crowdsourcing techniques.",106,"Computers","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UYdyEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UYdyEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=UYdyEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA46&dq=search+terms&hl=&cd=61&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UYdyEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","",NA,0

"MFQMEAAAQBAJ","Query Understanding for Search Engines","Yi Chang, Hongbo Deng","Springer Nature","12/1/20","This book presents a systematic study of practices and theories for query understanding of search engines. These studies can be categorized into three major classes. The first class is to figure out what the searcher wants by extracting semantic meaning from the searcher’s keywords, such as query classification, query tagging, and query intent understanding. The second class is to analyze search queries and then translate them into an enhanced query that can produce better search results, such as query spelling correction or query rewriting. The third class is to assist users in refining or suggesting queries in order to reduce users’ search effort and satisfy their information needs, such as query auto-completion and query suggestion. Query understanding is a fundamental part of search engines. It is responsible to precisely infer the intent of the query formulated by the search user, to correct spelling errors in his/her query, to reformulate the query to capture its intent more accurately, and to guide the user in formulating a query with precise intent. The book will be invaluable to researchers and graduate students in computer or information science and specializing in information retrieval or web-based systems, as well as to researchers and programmers working on the development or improvement of products related to search engines.",224,"Computers","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MFQMEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MFQMEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=MFQMEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=search+terms&hl=&cd=77&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MFQMEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","",NA,0

Here, the road network of non-Euclidean space has its unique characteristics such that two moving objects may be very close in a straight line distance. The index used in two-dimensional Euclidean space is not always appropriate for moving objects on road network. Therefore, the index structure needs to be improved in order to obtain suitable indexing methods, explore the shortest path and acquire nearest neighbor query and aggregation query methods under the new index structures. Chapter 1 of this book introduces the present situation of intelligent traffic and index in road network, Chapter 2 introduces the relevant existing spatial indexing methods. Chapter 3-5 focus on several issues of road network and query, they involves: traffic road network models (see Chapter 3), index structures (see Chapter 4) and aggregate query methods (see Chapter 5).

"9KpqCQAAQBAJ","Quality-Driven Query Answering for Integrated Information Systems","Felix Naumann","Springer","7/31/03","The Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW) are becoming more and more important in our highly interconnected world as more and more data and information is made available for online access. Many individuals and governmental, commercial, cultural, and scientific organizations increasingly depend on information sources that can be accessed and queried over the Web. For example, accessing flight schedules or retrieving stock information has become common practice in todays world. When accessing this data, many people assume that the information accessed is accurate and that the data source can be accessed reliably. These two examples clearly demonstrate that not only the information content is important, the information about the quality of the data becomes an even more crucial and critical aspect for individuals and organizations when they make plans or take decisions based on the results of their queries. More precisely, having access to information of known quality becomes critical for the well-being and indeed for the functioning of modern industrialized societies. Surprisingly, despite the urgent need for clear concepts and techniques to judge and value quality and for technology to use such (meta) information, very few scientific results are known and available. Few approaches are known to use quality measures for accessing and querying information over the Web. Only a limited number of products on the IT market address this burning problem.",168,"Computers","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9KpqCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9KpqCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=9KpqCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA154&dq=search+terms&hl=&cd=89&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9KpqCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","",NA,0

Strategies: A common strategy for finding all the words is to go through the puzzle left to right (or vice versa) and look for the first letter of the word (if a word list is provided). After finding the letter, one should look at the eight surrounding letters to see whether the next letter of the word is there. One can then continue this method until the entire word is found. Another strategy is to look for 'outstanding' letters within the word one is searching for (if a word list is provided). Since most word searches use capital letters, it is easiest to spot the letters that stand out from others. These letters are Q, O, U, X, and Z. Lastly, the strategy of looking for double letters in the word being searched for (if a word list is provided) proves helpful, because it is easier to spot two identical side-by-side letters among a large grid of random letters.",100,"","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r5cfMQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r5cfMQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=r5cfMQAACAAJ&dq=search+terms&hl=&cd=106&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books?id=r5cfMQAACAAJ&dq=search+terms&hl=&source=gbs_api","",NA,0

"RIRkzgEACAAJ","Brazil Word Search","Started Word Search","Independently Published","4/5/21","Word Search is a game composed of the letters of words formatted in a grid. Generally, the word game grid is rectangular or square in nature. The goal is to find and highlight all of the words hidden in the puzzle. The words may be placed diagonally, horizontally, vertically, or backward. All of the hidden words can be found in a list alongside the grid. Each word from the list will become a ""muted"" state after it has been highlighted in the puzzle. Word Searches are not only a great way to pass the time, but also provide a great exercise for keeping your brain fit. Word searches have been found to boost learning in a number of ways including increased processing speed, improved working memory (both short and long term memory), advancing logical and strategic thinking, expanding vocabulary, strengthening spelling proficiency, as well as providing a creative outlet for problem solving and competition.

In general, the earlier (or higher ranked on the search results page), and more frequently a site appears in the search results list, the more visitors it will receive from the search engine's users. SEO may target different kinds of search, including image search, local search, video search, academic search, news search and industry-specific vertical search engines. As an Internet marketing strategy, SEO considers how search engines work, what people search for, the actual search terms or keywords typed into search engines and which search engines are preferred by their targeted audience. Optimizing a website may involve editing its content, HTML and associated coding to both increase its relevance to specific keywords and to remove barriers to the indexing activities of search engines. Promoting a site to increase the number of backlinks, or inbound links, is another SEO tactic. The plural of the abbreviation SEO can also refer to ""search engine optimizers,"" those who provide SEO services.",40,"","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eqPVrQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eqPVrQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=eqPVrQEACAAJ&dq=search+terms&hl=&cd=135&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books?id=eqPVrQEACAAJ&dq=search+terms&hl=&source=gbs_api","",NA,0

"fBFkzgEACAAJ","Planet Word Search","Started Word Search","Independently Published","4/5/21","Word Search is a game composed of the letters of words formatted in a grid. Generally, the word game grid is rectangular or square in nature. The goal is to find and highlight all of the words hidden in the puzzle. The words may be placed diagonally, horizontally, vertically, or backward. All of the hidden words can be found in a list alongside the grid. Each word from the list will become a ""muted"" state after it has been highlighted in the puzzle. Word Searches are not only a great way to pass the time, but also provide a great exercise for keeping your brain fit. Word searches have been found to boost learning in a number of ways including increased processing speed, improved working memory (both short and long term memory), advancing logical and strategic thinking, expanding vocabulary, strengthening spelling proficiency, as well as providing a creative outlet for problem solving and competition.

For example ""Hang in There"" is shaped like a trapeze artist and includes things that might hang--like an ornament or your head. The words (approximately 25 per search) go vertically, horizontally, and diagonally; in an unusual touch, every word in a grid crosses at least one other, and all the words in a grid interconnect. And, as a bonus, every puzzle contains a hidden message--an answer to a punny riddle, a punch line to a silly joke--made up of the uncircled letters!",356,"Puzzles","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_Fm_6pRq5XAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_Fm_6pRq5XAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=_Fm_6pRq5XAC&q=search+terms&dq=search+terms&hl=&cd=245&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books?id=_Fm_6pRq5XAC&dq=search+terms&hl=&source=gbs_api","",NA,0

How to Solve Word Search Puzzles In order to achieve success at any task, one needs to know the best way to accomplish the goal of that task. With word search puzzle solving, the goal, of course, is to solve the puzzle. To do so, there are a number of methods one can use. They are as follows: * Take a Quick Look Glance at the puzzle and mark the ones you see immediately first. * Develop a Strategy As you work your word search puzzle, a strategy will help you to work faster and more efficiently 1) Check beginning letters. One successful strategy is to look for the beginning letter of the word for which you are searching. Then look at the box immediately to the left and right, above and below, and in both diagonal directions for the remaining letters. At this point, you should see the complete word. 2) Work each row in one direction. For example, work all the rows across first. Then choose another direction, maybe backwards across. Continue until the puzzle is completed. 3) Work the list. Some word search puzzle solvers simply work down the list, looking for each word. Of course, you want to go ahead and mark any other words you see. * Work in sections. Whichever method of solution you choose, work your word search puzzle in sections. You don't want to repeatedly do the same area of your puzzle. * Take a break. If you get stuck, stop and come back to the puzzle later. * Work cooperatively. You can work a puzzle as a cooperative effort. Working with someone else can be fun and make puzzle solving easier. * Relax. Don't become frustrated. Each consecutive puzzle should get easier. Go with the flow. * Have fun! Puzzle solving is supposed to be an enjoyable activity. Remember to make it one. What Are the Benefits of Word Search Puzzles? Working word search puzzles provides many benefits for our minds. * As proven in science, we can actually increase our effective IQ. * Also, word search puzzles provide our minds with exercise for stimulation and maintenance. * In addition, puzzles are good for your mind's cognitive (thinking and memory) development. * These puzzles provide great opportunity improve the brain's overall health and longevity; there is less memory loss at advanced age, as well as delayed onset and reduced risk of conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. * Scientific studies have found that our brains actually reorganize in response to new challenges; a word search puzzle provides such a challenge.

One successful strategy is to look for the beginning letter of the word for which you are searching. Then look at the box immediately to the left and right, above and below, and in both diagonal directions for the remaining letters. At this point, you should see the complete word. 2) Work each row in one direction. For example, work all the rows across first. Then choose another direction, maybe backwards across. Continue until the puzzle is completed. 3) Work the list. Some word search puzzle solvers simply work down the list, looking for each word. Of course, you want to go ahead and mark any other words you see. * Work in sections. Whichever method of solution you choose, work your word search puzzle in sections. You don't want to repeatedly do the same area of your puzzle. * Take a break. If you get stuck, stop and come back to the puzzle later. * Work cooperatively. You can work a puzzle as a cooperative effort. Working with someone else can be fun and make puzzle solving easier. * Relax. Don't become frustrated. Each consecutive puzzle should get easier. Go with the flow. * Have fun! Puzzle solving is supposed to be an enjoyable activity. Remember to make it one. What Are the Benefits of Word Search Puzzles?

"AOGpCAAAQBAJ","Query Processing in Database Systems","W. Kim, D.S. Reiner, Don Batory","Springer Science & Business Media","12/6/12","This book is an anthology of the results of research and development in database query processing during the past decade. The relational model of data provided tremendous impetus for research into query processing. Since a relational query does not specify access paths to the stored data, the database management system (DBMS) must provide an intelligent query-processing subsystem which will evaluate a number of potentially efficient strategies for processing the query and select the one that optimizes a given performance measure. The degree of sophistication of this subsystem, often called the optimizer, critically affects the performance of the DBMS. Research into query processing thus started has taken off in several directions during the past decade. The emergence of research into distributed databases has enormously complicated the tasks of the optimizer. In a distributed environment, the database may be partitioned into horizontal or vertical fragments of relations. Replicas of the fragments may be stored in different sites of a network and even migrate to other sites. The measure of performance of a query in a distributed system must include the communication cost between sites.

How to Solve Word Search Puzzles In order to achieve success at any task, one needs to know the best way to accomplish the goal of that task. With word search puzzle solving, the goal, of course, is to solve the puzzle. To do so, there are a number of methods one can use. They are as follows: * Take a Quick Look Glance at the puzzle and mark the ones you see immediately first. * Develop a Strategy As you work your word search puzzle, a strategy will help you to work faster and more efficiently 1) Check beginning letters. One successful strategy is to look for the beginning letter of the word for which you are searching. Then look at the box immediately to the left and right, above and below, and in both diagonal directions for the remaining letters. At this point, you should see the complete word. 2) Work each row in one direction. For example, work all the rows across first. Then choose another direction, maybe backwards across. Continue until the puzzle is completed. 3) Work the list. Some word search puzzle solvers simply work down the list, looking for each word. Of course, you want to go ahead and mark any other words you see. * Work in sections. Whichever method of solution you choose, work your word search puzzle in sections. You don't want to repeatedly do the same area of your puzzle. * Take a break. If you get stuck, stop and come back to the puzzle later. * Work cooperatively. You can work a puzzle as a cooperative effort. Working with someone else can be fun and make puzzle solving easier. * Relax. Don't become frustrated. Each consecutive puzzle should get easier. Go with the flow. * Have fun! Puzzle solving is supposed to be an enjoyable activity. Remember to make it one. What Are the Benefits of Word Search Puzzles? Working word search puzzles provides many benefits for our minds. * As proven in science, we can actually increase our effective IQ. * Also, word search puzzles provide our minds with exercise for stimulation and maintenance. * In addition, puzzles are good for your mind's cognitive (thinking and memory) development. * These puzzles provide great opportunity improve the brain's overall health and longevity; there is less memory loss at advanced age, as well as delayed onset and reduced risk of conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. * Scientific studies have found that our brains actually reorganize in response to new challenges; a word search puzzle provides such a challenge.

How to Solve Word Search Puzzles In order to achieve success at any task, one needs to know the best way to accomplish the goal of that task. With word search puzzle solving, the goal, of course, is to solve the puzzle. To do so, there are a number of methods one can use. They are as follows: - Take a Quick Look Glance at the puzzle and mark the ones you see immediately first. - Develop a Strategy As you work your word search puzzle, a strategy will help you to work faster and more efficiently 1) Check beginning letters. One successful strategy is to look for the beginning letter of the word for which you are searching. Then look at the box immediately to the left and right, above and below, and in both diagonal directions for the remaining letters. At this point, you should see the complete word. 2) Work each row in one direction. For example, work all the rows across first. Then choose another direction, maybe backwards across. Continue until the puzzle is completed. 3) Work the list. Some word search puzzle solvers simply work down the list, looking for each word. Of course, you want to go ahead and mark any other words you see. - Work in sections. Whichever method of solution you choose, work your word search puzzle in sections. You don't want to repeatedly do the same area of your puzzle. - Take a break. If you get stuck, stop and come back to the puzzle later. - Work cooperatively. You can work a puzzle as a cooperative effort. Working with someone else can be fun and make puzzle solving easier. - Relax. Don't become frustrated. Each consecutive puzzle should get easier.

"8ClkAgAAQBAJ","Conducting Biosocial Surveys","National Research Council, Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education, Committee on Population, Committee on National Statistics, Panel on Collecting, Storing, Accessing, and Protecting Biological Specimens and Biodata in Social Surveys","National Academies Press","10/2/10","Recent years have seen a growing tendency for social scientists to collect biological specimens such as blood, urine, and saliva as part of large-scale household surveys. By combining biological and social data, scientists are opening up new fields of inquiry and are able for the first time to address many new questions and connections. But including biospecimens in social surveys also adds a great deal of complexity and cost to the investigator's task. Along with the usual concerns about informed consent, privacy issues, and the best ways to collect, store, and share data, researchers now face a variety of issues that are much less familiar or that appear in a new light. In particular, collecting and storing human biological materials for use in social science research raises additional legal, ethical, and social issues, as well as practical issues related to the storage, retrieval, and sharing of data. For example, acquiring biological data and linking them to social science databases requires a more complex informed consent process, the development of a biorepository, the establishment of data sharing policies, and the creation of a process for deciding how the data are going to be shared and used for secondary analysis-all of which add cost to a survey and require additional time and attention from the investigators. These issues also are likely to be unfamiliar to social scientists who have not worked with biological specimens in the past. Adding to the attraction of collecting biospecimens but also to the complexity of sharing and protecting the data is the fact that this is an era of incredibly rapid gains in our understanding of complex biological and physiological phenomena. Thus the tradeoffs between the risks and opportunities of expanding access to research data are constantly changing. Conducting Biosocial Surveys offers findings and recommendations concerning the best approaches to the collection, storage, use, and sharing of biospecimens gathered in social science surveys and the digital representations of biological data derived therefrom. It is aimed at researchers interested in carrying out such surveys, their institutions, and their funding agencies.",124,"Computers","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8ClkAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8ClkAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=8ClkAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=search+terms&hl=&cd=371&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books?id=8ClkAgAAQBAJ&dq=search+terms&hl=&source=gbs_api","Collecting, Storing, Accessing, and Protecting Biospecimens and Biodata",NA,0

If you’re like most nonfiction authors, fears are holding you back. Sound familiar? Is my idea good enough? How do I structure a book? What exactly are the steps to write it? How do I stay motivated? What if I actually finish it, and it’s bad? Worst of all: what if I publish it, and no one cares? How do I know if I’m even doing the right things? The truth is, writing a book can be scary and overwhelming—but it doesn’t have to be. There’s a way to know you’re on the right path and taking the right steps. How? By using a method that’s been validated with thousands of other Authors just like you.

The Scribe Method is the tested and proven process that will help you navigate the entire book-writing process from start to finish–the right way.

This book contains 300 22x22 HARD THEMED WORD SEARCH PUZZLES designed to improve your intelligence quotient (IQ). IQ is a measure of the intelligence you already have. The IQ you use on a daily basis - your effective IQ - can be increased. Doing so can help you be more successful in your personal relationships, at work & in business as it increases your ability to solve and overcome problems, invent lateral solutions.

The puzzles are hard in difficulty. The solutions can be found vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, either forward or in reverse order. How to Solve Word Search Puzzles In order to achieve success at any task, one needs to know the best way to accomplish the goal of that task. With word search puzzle solving, the goal, of course, is to solve the puzzle. To do so, there are a number of methods one can use. They are as follows: * Take a Quick Look Glance at the puzzle and mark the ones you see immediately first. * Develop a Strategy As you work your word search puzzle, a strategy will help you to work faster and more efficiently 1) Check beginning letters. One successful strategy is to look for the beginning letter of the word for which you are searching. Then look at the box immediately to the left and right, above and below, and in both diagonal directions for the remaining letters. At this point, you should see the complete word. 2) Work each row in one direction. For example, work all the rows across first. Then choose another direction, maybe backwards across. Continue until the puzzle is completed. 3) Work the list. Some word search puzzle solvers simply work down the list, looking for each word. Of course, you want to go ahead and mark any other words you see. * Work in sections. Whichever method of solution you choose, work your word search puzzle in sections. You don't want to repeatedly do the same area of your puzzle. * Take a break. If you get stuck, stop and come back to the puzzle later. * Work cooperatively. You can work a puzzle as a cooperative effort. Working with someone else can be fun and make puzzle solving easier. * Relax. Don't become frustrated. Each consecutive puzzle should get easier. Go with the flow. * Have fun! Puzzle solving is supposed to be an enjoyable activity. Remember to make it one. What Are the Benefits of Word Search Puzzles? Working word search puzzles provides many benefits for our minds. * As proven in science, we can actually increase our effective IQ. * Also, word search puzzles provide our minds with exercise for stimulation and maintenance. * In addition, puzzles are good for your mind's cognitive (thinking and memory) development. * These puzzles provide great opportunity improve the brain's overall health and longevity; there is less memory loss at advanced age, as well as delayed onset and reduced risk of conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. * Scientific studies have found that our brains actually reorganize in response to new challenges; a word search puzzle provides such a challenge.

"pFoJCgAAQBAJ","Grit","Angela Duckworth","Simon and Schuster","5/3/16","In this instant New York Times bestseller, Angela Duckworth shows anyone striving to succeed that the secret to outstanding achievement is not talent, but a special blend of passion and persistence she calls “grit.” “Inspiration for non-geniuses everywhere” (People). The daughter of a scientist who frequently noted her lack of “genius,” Angela Duckworth is now a celebrated researcher and professor. It was her early eye-opening stints in teaching, business consulting, and neuroscience that led to her hypothesis about what really drives success: not genius, but a unique combination of passion and long-term perseverance. In Grit, she takes us into the field to visit cadets struggling through their first days at West Point, teachers working in some of the toughest schools, and young finalists in the National Spelling Bee. She also mines fascinating insights from history and shows what can be gleaned from modern experiments in peak performance. Finally, she shares what she’s learned from interviewing dozens of high achievers—from JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon to New Yorker cartoon editor Bob Mankoff to Seattle Seahawks Coach Pete Carroll. “Duckworth’s ideas about the cultivation of tenacity have clearly changed some lives for the better” (The New York Times Book Review). Among Grit’s most valuable insights: any effort you make ultimately counts twice toward your goal; grit can be learned, regardless of IQ or circumstances; when it comes to child-rearing, neither a warm embrace nor high standards will work by themselves; how to trigger lifelong interest; the magic of the Hard Thing Rule; and so much more. Winningly personal, insightful, and even life-changing, Grit is a book about what goes through your head when you fall down, and how that—not talent or luck—makes all the difference. This is “a fascinating tour of the psychological research on success” (The Wall Street Journal).",352,"Self-Help","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pFoJCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pFoJCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=pFoJCgAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=search+terms&hl=&cd=380&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pFoJCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","The Power of Passion and Perseverance",3.5,19

Higgins, Sally Green","Wiley","11/24/08","Healthcare providers, consumers, researchers and policy makers are inundated with unmanageable amounts of information, including evidence from healthcare research. It has become impossible for all to have the time and resources to find, appraise and interpret this evidence and incorporate it into healthcare decisions. Cochrane Reviews respond to this challenge by identifying, appraising and synthesizing research-based evidence and presenting it in a standardized format, published in The Cochrane Library (www.thecochranelibrary.com). The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions contains methodological guidance for the preparation and maintenance of Cochrane intervention reviews. Written in a clear and accessible format, it is the essential manual for all those preparing, maintaining and reading Cochrane reviews. Many of the principles and methods described here are appropriate for systematic reviews applied to other types of research and to systematic reviews of interventions undertaken by others. It is hoped therefore that this book will be invaluable to all those who want to understand the role of systematic reviews, critically appraise published reviews or perform reviews themselves.",672,"Medical","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RepLNQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RepLNQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=RepLNQEACAAJ&dq=search+terms&hl=&cd=395&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books?id=RepLNQEACAAJ&dq=search+terms&hl=&source=gbs_api","",NA,0

"_M9vDwAAQBAJ","Dare to Lead","Brené Brown","Random House","10/9/18","#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Brené Brown has taught us what it means to dare greatly, rise strong, and brave the wilderness. Now, based on new research conducted with leaders, change makers, and culture shifters, she’s showing us how to put those ideas into practice so we can step up and lead. Don’t miss the five-part HBO Max docuseries Brené Brown: Atlas of the Heart! NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY BLOOMBERG Leadership is not about titles, status, and wielding power. A leader is anyone who takes responsibility for recognizing the potential in people and ideas, and has the courage to develop that potential. When we dare to lead, we don’t pretend to have the right answers; we stay curious and ask the right questions. We don’t see power as finite and hoard it; we know that power becomes infinite when we share it with others. We don’t avoid difficult conversations and situations; we lean into vulnerability when it’s necessary to do good work. But daring leadership in a culture defined by scarcity, fear, and uncertainty requires skill-building around traits that are deeply and uniquely human. The irony is that we’re choosing not to invest in developing the hearts and minds of leaders at the exact same time as we’re scrambling to figure out what we have to offer that machines and AI can’t do better and faster. What can we do better? Empathy, connection, and courage, to start. Four-time #1 New York Times bestselling author Brené Brown has spent the past two decades studying the emotions and experiences that give meaning to our lives, and the past seven years working with transformative leaders and teams spanning the globe. She found that leaders in organizations ranging from small entrepreneurial startups and family-owned businesses to nonprofits, civic organizations, and Fortune 50 companies all ask the same question: How do you cultivate braver, more daring leaders, and how do you embed the value of courage in your culture? In this new book, Brown uses research, stories, and examples to answer these questions in the no-BS style that millions of readers have come to expect and love. Brown writes, “One of the most important findings of my career is that daring leadership is a collection of four skill sets that are 100 percent teachable, observable, and measurable. It’s learning and unlearning that requires brave work, tough conversations, and showing up with your whole heart. Easy? No. Because choosing courage over comfort is not always our default. Worth it? Always. We want to be brave with our lives and our work. It’s why we’re here.” Whether you’ve read Daring Greatly and Rising Strong or you’re new to Brené Brown’s work, this book is for anyone who wants to step up and into brave leadership.",321,"Business & Economics","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_M9vDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_M9vDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=_M9vDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=search+terms&hl=&cd=414&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books?id=_M9vDwAAQBAJ&dq=search+terms&hl=&source=gbs_api","Brave Work.

"71jHDwAAQBAJ","An Ecotopian Lexicon","Matthew Schneider-Mayerson, Brent Ryan Bellamy","U of Minnesota Press","10/22/19","Presents thirty novel terms that do not yet exist in English to envision ways of responding to the environmental challenges of our generation As the scale and gravity of climate change becomes undeniable, a cultural revolution must ultimately match progress in the realms of policy, infrastructure, and technology. Proceeding from the notion that dominant Western cultures lack the terms and concepts to describe or respond to our environmental crisis, An Ecotopian Lexicon is a collaborative volume of short, engaging essays that offer ecologically productive terms—drawn from other languages, science fiction, and subcultures of resistance—to envision and inspire responses and alternatives to fossil-fueled neoliberal capitalism. Each of the thirty suggested “loanwords” helps us imagine how to adapt and even flourish in the face of the socioecological adversity that characterizes the present moment and the future that awaits. From “Apocalypso” to “Qi,” “ ~*~ “ to “Total Liberation,” thirty authors from a range of disciplines and backgrounds assemble a grounded yet dizzying lexicon, expanding the limited European and North American conceptual lexicon that many activists, educators, scholars, students, and citizens have inherited. Fourteen artists from eleven countries respond to these chapters with original artwork that illustrates the contours of the possible better worlds and worldviews.

Orphaned as a baby, nineteen-year-old Signa has been raised by a string of guardians, each more interested in her wealth than her well-being—and each has met an untimely end. Her remaining relatives are the elusive Hawthornes, an eccentric family living at Thorn Grove, an estate both glittering and gloomy. Its patriarch mourns his late wife through wild parties, while his son grapples for control of the family’s waning reputation, and his daughter suffers from a mysterious illness. But when their mother’s restless spirit appears claiming she was poisoned, Signa realizes that the family she depends on could be in grave danger and enlists the help of a surly stable boy to hunt down the killer. However, Signa’s best chance of uncovering the murderer is an alliance with Death himself, a fascinating, dangerous shadow who has never been far from her side. Though he’s made her life a living hell, Death shows Signa that their growing connection may be more powerful—and more irresistible—than she ever dared imagine.",341,"Young Adult Fiction","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=v1lHEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=v1lHEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=v1lHEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=search+terms&hl=&cd=428&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=v1lHEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","",4,3

With the rise of data analytics solutions these years, the need for this data preparation becomes even more essential. Power BI is a helpful data analytics tool that is used worldwide by many users. As a Power BI (or Microsoft BI) developer, it is essential to learn how to prepare the data in the right shape and format needed. You need to learn how to clean the data and build it in a structure that can be modeled easily and used high performant for visualization. Data preparation and transformation is the backend work. If you consider building a BI system as going to a restaurant and ordering food. The visualization is the food you see on the table nicely presented. The quality, the taste, and everything else come from the hard work in the kitchen. The part that you don’t see or the backend in the world of Power BI is Power Query. You may already be familiar with other data preparation and transformation technologies, such as T-SQL, SSIS, Azure Data Factory, Informatica, etc. Power Query is a data transformation engine capable of preparing the data in the format you need. The good news is that to learn Power Query; you don’t need to know programming. Power Query is for citizen data engineers. However, this doesn’t mean that Power Query is not capable of performing advanced transformation. Power Query exists in many Microsoft tools and services such as Power BI, Excel, Dataflows, Power Automate, Azure Data Factory, etc. Through the years, this engine became more powerful. These days, we can say this is essential learning for anyone who wants to do data analysis with Microsoft technology to learn Power Query and master it. We have been working with Power Query since the very early release of that in 2013, named Data Explorer, and wrote blog articles and published videos about it. The number of articles we published under this subject easily exceeds hundreds. Through those articles, some of the fundamentals and key learnings of Power Query are explained. We thought it is good to compile some of them in a book series. A good analytics solution combines a good data model, good data preparation, and good analytics and calculations. Reza has written another book about the Basics of modeling in Power BI and a book on Power BI DAX Simplified. This book is covering the data preparation and transformations aspects of it. This book series is for you if you are building a Power BI solution. Even if you are just visualizing the data, preparation and transformations are an essential part of analytics. You do need to have the cleaned and prepared data ready before visualizing it. This book is compiled into a series of two books, which will be followed by a third book later; Getting started with Power Query in Power BI and Excel (already available to be purchased separately) Mastering Power Query in Power BI and Excel (This book) Power Query dataflows (will be published later) This book deeps dive into real-world challenges of data transformation. It starts with combining data sources and continues with aggregations and fuzzy operations. The book covers advanced usage of Power Query in scenarios such as error handling and exception reports, custom functions and parameters, advanced analytics, and some helpful table and list functions. The book continues with some performance tuning tips and it also explains the Power Query formula language (M) and the structure of it and how to use it in practical solutions.

"NKcLzMnBOvcC","Finding What Works in Health Care","Institute of Medicine, Board on Health Care Services, Committee on Standards for Systematic Reviews of Comparative Effectiveness Research","National Academies Press","7/20/11","Healthcare decision makers in search of reliable information that compares health interventions increasingly turn to systematic reviews for the best summary of the evidence. Systematic reviews identify, select, assess, and synthesize the findings of similar but separate studies, and can help clarify what is known and not known about the potential benefits and harms of drugs, devices, and other healthcare services. Systematic reviews can be helpful for clinicians who want to integrate research findings into their daily practices, for patients to make well-informed choices about their own care, for professional medical societies and other organizations that develop clinical practice guidelines. Too often systematic reviews are of uncertain or poor quality. There are no universally accepted standards for developing systematic reviews leading to variability in how conflicts of interest and biases are handled, how evidence is appraised, and the overall scientific rigor of the process. In Finding What Works in Health Care the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommends 21 standards for developing high-quality systematic reviews of comparative effectiveness research. The standards address the entire systematic review process from the initial steps of formulating the topic and building the review team to producing a detailed final report that synthesizes what the evidence shows and where knowledge gaps remain. Finding What Works in Health Care also proposes a framework for improving the quality of the science underpinning systematic reviews. This book will serve as a vital resource for both sponsors and producers of systematic reviews of comparative effectiveness research.",267,"Medical","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NKcLzMnBOvcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NKcLzMnBOvcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=NKcLzMnBOvcC&pg=PP1&dq=search+terms&hl=&cd=493&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books?id=NKcLzMnBOvcC&dq=search+terms&hl=&source=gbs_api","Standards for Systematic Reviews",NA,0

"DTeZAAAAQBAJ","The Long Tail","Chris Anderson","Hachette Books","7/11/06","What happens when the bottlenecks that stand between supply and demand in our culture go away and everything becomes available to everyone? ""The Long Tail"" is a powerful new force in our economy: the rise of the niche. As the cost of reaching consumers drops dramatically, our markets are shifting from a one-size-fits-all model of mass appeal to one of unlimited variety for unique tastes. From supermarket shelves to advertising agencies, the ability to offer vast choice is changing everything, and causing us to rethink where our markets lie and how to get to them. Unlimited selection is revealing truths about what consumers want and how they want to get it, from DVDs at Netflix to songs on iTunes to advertising on Google. However, this is not just a virtue of online marketplaces; it is an example of an entirely new economic model for business, one that is just beginning to show its power. After a century of obsessing over the few products at the head of the demand curve, the new economics of distribution allow us to turn our focus to the many more products in the tail, which collectively can create a new market as big as the one we already know. The Long Tail is really about the economics of abundance. New efficiencies in distribution, manufacturing, and marketing are essentially resetting the definition of what's commercially viable across the board. If the 20th century was about hits, the 21st will be equally about niches.",256,"Business & Economics","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DTeZAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DTeZAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=DTeZAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=search+terms&hl=&cd=503&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DTeZAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","Why the Future of Business Is Selling Less of More",4,41

"nCiSAgAAQBAJ","Cancer","Victor R. Preedy","Academic Press","3/1/14","Cancer: Oxidative Stress and Dietary Antioxidants bridges the trans-disciplinary divide and covers in a single volume the science of oxidative stress in cancer and then the potentially therapeutic usage of natural antioxidants in the diet or food matrix. The processes within the science of oxidative stress are described in concert with other processes such as apoptosis, cell signaling, and receptor mediated responses. This approach recognizes that diseases are often multifactorial and that oxidative stress is a single component of this. Oncologists, cancer researchers, and nutritionists are separated by divergent skills and professional disciplines that need to be bridged in order to advance preventative as well as treatment strategies. While oncologists and cancer researchers may study the underlying pathogenesis of cancer, they are less likely to be conversant in the science of nutrition and dietetics. On the other hand, nutritionists and dietitians are less conversant with the detailed clinical background and science of oncology. This book addresses this gap and brings each of these disciplines to bear on the processes inherent in the oxidative stress of cancer. Nutritionists can apply information related to mitochondrial oxidative stress in one disease to diet-related strategies in another unrelated disease Dietitians can prescribe new foods or diets containing anti-oxidants for conditions resistant to conventional pharmacological treatments Dietitians, after learning about the basic biology of oxidative stress, will be able to suggest new treatments to their multidisciplinary teams Nutritionists and dietitians will gain an understanding of cell signaling, and be able to suggest new preventative or therapeutic strategies with anti-oxidant rich foods",308,"Medical","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nCiSAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nCiSAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=nCiSAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=search+terms&hl=&cd=510&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nCiSAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","Oxidative Stress and Dietary Antioxidants",NA,0

"oNT3AwAAQBAJ","I'm Feeling Lucky","Douglas Edwards","HMH","7/12/11","A marketing director’s story of working at a startup called Google in the early days of the tech boom: “Vivid inside stories . . . Engrossing” (Ken Auletta). Douglas Edwards wasn’t an engineer or a twentysomething fresh out of school when he received a job offer from a small but growing search engine company at the tail end of the 1990s. But founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin needed staff to develop the brand identity of their brainchild, and Edwards fit the bill with his journalistic background at the San Jose Mercury News, the newspaper of Silicon Valley. It was a change of pace for Edwards, to say the least, and put him in a unique position to interact with and observe the staff as Google began its rocket ride to the top. In entertaining, self-deprecating style, he tells his story of participating in this moment of business and technology history, giving readers a chance to fully experience the bizarre mix of camaraderie and competition at this phenomenal company. Edwards, Google’s first director of marketing and brand management, describes the idiosyncratic Page and Brin, the evolution of the famously nonhierarchical structure in which every employee finds a problem to tackle and works independently, the races to develop and implement each new feature, and the many ideas that never came to pass. I’m Feeling Lucky reveals what it’s like to be “indeed lucky, sort of an accidental millionaire, a reluctant bystander in a sea of computer geniuses who changed the world. This is a rare look at what happened inside the building of the most important company of our time” (Seth Godin, author of Linchpin). “An affectionate, compulsively readable recounting of the early years (1999–2005) of Google . . . This lively, thoughtful business memoir is more entertaining than it really has any right to be, and should be required reading for startup aficionados.” —Publishers Weekly, starred review “Edwards recounts Google’s stumbles and rise with verve and humor and a generosity of spirit.

There is an implication that individuals who are bullied must have ""asked for"" this type of treatment, or deserved it. Sometimes, even the child who is bullied begins to internalize this idea. For many years, there has been a general acceptance and collective shrug when it comes to a child or adolescent with greater social capital or power pushing around a child perceived as subordinate. But bullying is not developmentally appropriate; it should not be considered a normal part of the typical social grouping that occurs throughout a child's life. Although bullying behavior endures through generations, the milieu is changing. Historically, bulling has occurred at school, the physical setting in which most of childhood is centered and the primary source for peer group formation. In recent years, however, the physical setting is not the only place bullying is occurring. Technology allows for an entirely new type of digital electronic aggression, cyberbullying, which takes place through chat rooms, instant messaging, social media, and other forms of digital electronic communication. Composition of peer groups, shifting demographics, changing societal norms, and modern technology are contextual factors that must be considered to understand and effectively react to bullying in the United States. Youth are embedded in multiple contexts and each of these contexts interacts with individual characteristics of youth in ways that either exacerbate or attenuate the association between these individual characteristics and bullying perpetration or victimization. Recognizing that bullying behavior is a major public health problem that demands the concerted and coordinated time and attention of parents, educators and school administrators, health care providers, policy makers, families, and others concerned with the care of children, this report evaluates the state of the science on biological and psychosocial consequences of peer victimization and the risk and protective factors that either increase or decrease peer victimization behavior and consequences.",361,"Law","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=E7uhDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=E7uhDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=E7uhDQAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=search+terms&hl=&cd=533&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=E7uhDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","",NA,0

The Business of Being a Writer offers the business education writers need but so rarely receive. It is meant for early-career writers looking to develop a realistic set of expectations about making money from their work or for working writers who want a better understanding of the industry. Writers will gain a comprehensive picture of how the publishing world works—from queries and agents to blogging and advertising—and will learn how they can best position themselves for success over the long term. Jane Friedman has more than twenty years of experience in the publishing industry, with an emphasis on digital media strategy for authors and publishers.

"Z_OhDwAAQBAJ","The Longing for Less","Kyle Chayka","Bloomsbury Publishing USA","1/21/20","New York Times Book Review Editor's Choice ""More than just a story of an abiding cultural preoccupation, The Longing For Less peels back the commodified husk of minimalism to reveal something surprising and thoroughly alive."" -Jenny Odell, author of How to Do Nothing “Less is more”: Everywhere we hear the mantra. Marie Kondo and other decluttering gurus promise that shedding our stuff will solve our problems. We commit to cleanse diets and strive for inbox zero. Amid the frantic pace and distraction of everyday life, we covet silence-and airy, Instagrammable spaces in which to enjoy it. The popular term for this brand of upscale austerity, “minimalism,” has mostly come to stand for things to buy and consume. But minimalism has richer, deeper, and altogether more valuable gifts to offer. Kyle Chayka is one of our sharpest cultural observers. After spending years covering minimalist trends for leading publications, he now delves beneath this lifestyle's glossy surface, seeking better ways to claim the time and space we crave. He shows that our longing for less goes back further than we realize. His search leads him to the philosophical and spiritual origins of minimalism, and to the stories of artists such as Agnes Martin and Donald Judd; composers such as John Cage and Julius Eastman; architects and designers; visionaries and misfits. As Chayka looks anew at their extraordinary lives and explores the places where they worked-from Manhattan lofts to the Texas high desert and the back alleys of Kyoto-he reminds us that what we most require is presence, not absence. The result is an elegant new synthesis of our minimalist desires and our profound emotional needs.",272,"House & Home","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Z_OhDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Z_OhDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=Z_OhDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=search+terms&hl=&cd=571&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Z_OhDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","Living with Minimalism",4,1

Demand for the people who can produce it far outweighs the supply. So why do developers occupy largely subordinate roles in the corporate structure? Developer Hegemony explores the past, present, and future of the corporation and what it means for developers. While it outlines problems with the modern corporate structure, it’s ultimately a play-by-play of how to leave the corporate carnival and control your own destiny. And it’s an emboldening, specific vision of what software development looks like in the world of developer hegemony—one where developers band together into partner firms of “efficiencers,” finally able to command the pay, respect, and freedom that’s earned by solving problems no one else can. Developers, if you grow tired of being treated like geeks who can only be trusted to take orders and churn out code, consider this your call to arms. Bring about the autonomous future that’s rightfully yours.

Forty years later, questions about reproductive rights are just as complex--and controversial--as they were then. Focusing mainly on the United States, Reproductive Politics: What Everyone Needs to Know® explores the legal, political, religious, social, ethical, and medical dimensions of this hotly contested arena. Tracing the historical roots of reproductive politics up through the present, Rickie Solinger considers a range of topics from abortion and contraception to health care reform and assisted reproductive technologies. Solinger tackles some of the most contentious questions up for debate today, including the definition of ""fetal personhood,"" and the roles poverty and welfare policy play in shaping reproductive rights. The answers she provides are informative, balanced, and sometimes quite surprising. Offering a wide range of information in an accessible and engaging manner, Reproductive Politics: What Everyone Needs to Know® orients readers and provides the knowledge necessary to follow the debates in this important and continually evolving field.

"bXaozgEACAAJ","Attribution Modelling in Google Analytics and Beyond","Himanshu Sharma","Blurb","9/29/21","Attribution modelling is the process of understanding and assigning conversion credit to marketing channels. The primary objective of attribution modelling is to understand the buying behaviour of your website visitors and to determine the most effective marketing channels for investment at a particular point in time. A lot has been said about attribution modelling over the years. However, talking about attribution is the easy bit. Implementing it is the real challenge. This book has been written to help you implement attribution modelling in your organisation. This expert guide will help your organisation think about marketing holistically. It will teach you to leverage the knowledge of attribution modelling while allocating your marketing budget and helping you understand your users' buying behaviour. In this book, there is a strong focus on using Google Analytics and other Google tools and technologies, such as Google Ads (AdWords). I have explained various attribution models mainly in the context of Google Analytics. However, a large portion of this book does not deal with Google Analytics at all. So even if you have never used Google Analytics before, you can still benefit from this book. To get the maximum benefit from this book, you will need a working knowledge of Google Analytics and ecommerce. No knowledge of statistics or traditional marketing mix modelling is required. Any person who wants to improve the online performance of their business and marketing campaigns should read this book. Online marketers, web analysts, and data scientists will benefit the most from this book. If you have a strong background in traditional marketing mix modelling you will benefit tremendously from this book because it will enable you to integrate attribution modelling data with your MMM data. By feeding the attribution modelling data to your MMM model you can truly measure your overall marketing effectiveness and fix attribution issues.",480,"","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bXaozgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bXaozgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=bXaozgEACAAJ&dq=search+terms&hl=&cd=653&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books?id=bXaozgEACAAJ&dq=search+terms&hl=&source=gbs_api","",NA,0

But the corrupted Wood stands on the border, full of malevolent power, and its shadow lies over her life. Her people rely on the cold, driven wizard known only as the Dragon to keep its powers at bay. But he demands a terrible price for his help: one young woman handed over to serve him for ten years, a fate almost as terrible as falling to the Wood. The next choosing is fast approaching, and Agnieszka is afraid. She knows—everyone knows—that the Dragon will take Kasia: beautiful, graceful, brave Kasia, all the things Agnieszka isn’t, and her dearest friend in the world. And there is no way to save her. But Agnieszka fears the wrong things. For when the Dragon comes, it is not Kasia he will choose. Praise for Uprooted “Uprooted has leapt forward to claim the title of Best Book I’ve Read Yet This Year. . . .

"0X_1HS13FbsC","Google and the Culture of Search","Ken Hillis, Michael Petit, Kylie Jarrett","Routledge","2013","""Google and the Culture of Search examines the role of search technologies in shaping the contemporary digital and informational landscape. Ken Hillis and Michael Petit shed light on a culture of search in which our increasing reliance on search engines like Google, Yahoo! and Bing influences the way we navigate Web content--and how we think about ourselves and the world around us, online and off. Even as it becomes the number one internet activity, the very ubiquity of search technology naturalizes it as utilitarian and transparent--an assumption that Hillis and Petit explode in this innovative study. Commercial search engines supply an infrastructure that impacts the way we locate, prioritize, classify, and archive information on the Web, and as these search functionalities continue to make their way into our lives through mobile, GPS-based platforms and personalized results, distinctions between the virtual and the real collapse. Google--a multibillion-dollar global corporation--holds the balance of power among search providers, and the biases and individuating tendencies of its search algorithm undeniably shape our collective experience of the internet and our assumptions about the location and value of information. Google and the Culture of Search explores what is at stake for an increasingly networked culture in which search technology is a site of knowledge and power. This comprehensive study of search technology's broader implications for knowledge production and social relations is an indispensable resource for students and scholars of Internet and new media studies, the digital humanities, and information technology""--",258,"Social Science","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0X_1HS13FbsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0X_1HS13FbsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=0X_1HS13FbsC&pg=PP1&dq=search+terms&hl=&cd=665&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books?id=0X_1HS13FbsC&dq=search+terms&hl=&source=gbs_api","",NA,0

"CXLgAgAAQBAJ","School Bullying","Robin May Schott, Dorte Marie Søndergaard","Cambridge University Press","2/6/14","Bullying is a socially and culturally complex phenomenon that until now has largely been understood in the context of the individual. This book challenges the dominance of this approach, examining the processes of extreme exclusion that are enacted in bullying - whether at school, through face-to-face meetings or virtual encounters - in the context of group dynamics. Contributors draw upon qualitative empirical studies, mixed methods and statistics, to analyse the elements that allow bullying to emerge - the processes that produce exclusion and contempt, and the relations between children, teachers and parents. Introducing a new definition of bullying, this book goes on to discuss directions for future research and action, including more informed intervention strategies and re-thinking methods of prevention.

Smith","SAGE","5/1/14","'This extraordinarily comprehensive book authored by the leading international authority in the field integrates research, theory and practice on the topic of school bullying. In an already research saturated field Peter Smith's writing captures the humanity of why this topic strikes such a chord in the community. He reminds us in a thoughtful, practical and caring manner why we must continue to advocate on all levels for those impacted by bullying.' -Professor Phillip T. Slee, Flinders University, Australia 'Understanding School Bullying offers a refreshingly clear account of the wealth of insights gained over a quarter of a century of research. As Smith's comprehensive review convincingly shows, much has been learned and much of this has been put to good use in improving children's wellbeing. This is surely essential reading for any researcher concerned with bullying, childhood or life at school.' -Sonia Livingstone, London School of Economics and Political Science, UK, author of Children, Risk and Safety Online 'Peter Smith's new book will occupy a prominent place on my bookshelf. It provides a thorough and highly readable discussion of the breadth of research on school bullying. Dr. Smith includes discussions of important challenges related to research on this topic along with an excellent review of important studies and findings. This unique volume has influenced my thinking about the direction of my own research. The book will be an invaluable resource for researchers, consumers of research, and others who seek a research-based understanding of this important topic.' -Sheri Bauman, Ph.D., Professor at University of Arizona Bullying involves the repeated abuse of power in relationships. Bullying in schools can blight the lives of victims and damage the climate of the school. Over the last 25 years a burgeoning research program on school bullying has led to new insights into effective ways of dealing with it, as well as new challenges such as the advent of cyberbullying. This new book, by a leading international expert on the topic, brings together the cumulative knowledge acquired and the latest research findings in the area, with a global perspective especially covering research in Europe, North America, Australasia, and Asia.

She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells—taken without her knowledge—became one of the most important tools in medicine: The first “immortal” human cells grown in culture, which are still alive today, though she has been dead for more than sixty years. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave. Henrietta’s family did not learn of her “immortality” until more than twenty years after her death, when scientists investigating HeLa began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. And though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials, her family never saw any of the profits. As Rebecca Skloot so brilliantly shows, the story of the Lacks family—past and present—is inextricably connected to the dark history of experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of. Over the decade it took to uncover this story, Rebecca became enmeshed in the lives of the Lacks family—especially Henrietta’s daughter Deborah. Deborah was consumed with questions: Had scientists cloned her mother? Had they killed her to harvest her cells? And if her mother was so important to medicine, why couldn’t her children afford health insurance? Intimate in feeling, astonishing in scope, and impossible to put down, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks captures the beauty and drama of scientific discovery, as well as its human consequences.",400,"Science","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GFevO-QxQDgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GFevO-QxQDgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=GFevO-QxQDgC&pg=PP1&dq=search+terms&hl=&cd=708&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GFevO-QxQDgC&source=gbs_api","",4,4072

"Ea5zCgAAQBAJ","Abortion: A Documentary and Reference Guide","Melody Rose","ABC-CLIO","1/30/08","This thought-provoking reference work explores the evolution of America's heated abortion debate in a selection of over 40 primary documents from the 19th century to the present day. The guide includes not only key laws and court cases that have determined abortion policy, but also political speeches, medical essays, theological writings, newspaper advertisements, magazine articles, and popular books that offer insight into America's changing attitudes towards women, race, the medical field, and the role of government in its citizens' personal lives. Each document is preceded by an introduction and is followed by analysis to help readers understand its significance and historical context. Today abortion is America's most contentious political and religious rallying point. Yet 150 years ago it was a virtual non-issue, quietly performed for centuries by women and mid-wives. What changed? This thought-provoking reference work explores the evolution of America's abortion debate in a balanced selection of over 40 primary documents by doctors, feminists, religious leaders, politicians, extremists, and judges from the 19th century to the present day. This guide not only examines the key laws and court cases, like Roe v. Wade and the Partial Birth Abortion Ban, that have determined abortion policy, but offers insight into America's changing attitudes towards women, race, the medical field, and the role of government in its citizens' personal lives. Memoirs of early abortion providers, excerpts from popular women's self-help books, the complete text of Pope Paul VI's Humanae Vitae, and personal writings from key liberal and conservative figures on both sides of the debate provide a more complete picture of an issue that is deeply personal, deeply divisive, and anything but clear-cut. A straightforward and accessible book, ideal for both students and general readers looking to expand their understanding of one of the most complicated, and still unresolved, issues of our day. Each excerpt is preceded by a brief explanation of its significance and followed by author analysis to help readers understand its implications and the historical context in which is it was written. Readers gain direct access to America's most important legal papers and transcripts on abortion, complimented by a well rounded view of the public beliefs and sentiments that have fueled abortion debates. Suggestions for further reading conclude each chapter, perfect for research or to guide interested readers in their search for material. The front matter includes a Timeline of major events in abortion history, and the back matter, offers a Bibliography of 50 titles on abortion and over 30 Web links.",272,"Social Science","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ea5zCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ea5zCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=Ea5zCgAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=search+terms&hl=&cd=710&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ea5zCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","A Documentary and Reference Guide",NA,0

"95sSoK4b2GwC","Waiting for Your Cat to Bark?","Bryan Eisenberg, Jeffrey Eisenberg","HarperCollins Leadership","9/9/07","Evolving from the premise that customers have always behaved more like cats than Pavlov's dogs, Waiting for Your Cat to Bark? examines how emerging media have undermined the effectiveness of prevailing mass marketing models. At the same time, emerging media have created an unprecedented opportunity for businesses to redefine how they communicate with customers by leveraging the power of increasingly interconnected media channels. Bryan and Jeffrey Eisenberg don't simply explain this shift in paradigm; Waiting for Your Cat to Bark? introduces Persuasion Architecture™ as the synthetic model that provides business with a proven context for rethinking customers and retooling marketers in a rewired market. Readers will learn: Why many marketers are unprepared for today's increasingly fragmented, in-control, always-on audience that makes pin-point relevance mandatory How interactivity has changed the nature of marketing by extending its reach into the world of sales, design, merchandizing, and customer relations How Persuasion Architecture™ allows businesses to create powerful, multi-channel persuasive systems that anticipate customer needs How Persuasion Architecture™ allows businesses to measure and optimize the return on investment for every discreet piece of that persuasive system ""There's some big thinking going on here-thinking you will need if you want to take your work to the next level. 'Typical, not average' is just one of the ideas inside that will change the way you think about marketing."" ?Seth Godin, Author, All Marketers Are Liars ""Are your clients coming to you armed with more product information than you or your sales team know? You need to read Waiting for Your Cat to Bark? to learn how people are buying in the post-Internet age so you can learn how to sell to them."" ?Tom Hopkins, Master Sales Trainer and Author, How to Master the Art of Selling ""These guys really 'get it.' In a world of know-it-all marketing hypesters, these guys realize that it takes work to persuade people who aren't listening. They've connected a lot of the pieces that we all already know-plus a lot that we don't. It's a rare approach that recognizes that the customer is in charge and must be encouraged and engaged on his/her own terms, not the sellers. Waiting for Your Cat to Bark? takes apart the persuasion process, breaks down the steps and gives practical ways to tailor your approaches to your varying real customers in the real world. This book is at a high level that marketers better hope their competitors will be too lazy to implement."" ?George Silverman, Author, The Secrets of Word of Mouth Marketing: How to Trigger Exponential Sales Through Runaway Word of Mouth ""We often hear that the current marketing model is broken-meaning the changes in customers, media, distribution, and even the flatness of the world make current practices no longer relevant. Yet few have offered a solution. This book recognizes the new reality in which we operate and provides a path for moving forward. The authors do an outstanding job of using metaphors to help make Persuasion Architecture clear and real-life examples to make it come alive. Finally, someone has offered direction for how to market in this new era where the customer is in control."" ?David J. Reibstein, William Stewart Woodside Professor, Wharton Business School of the University of Pennsylvania and former Executive Director, Marketing Science Institute ""If you want to learn persistence, get a cat. If you want to learn marketing, get this book.

The Jews of the Sitka District have created their own little world in the Alaskan panhandle, a vibrant and complex frontier city that moves to the music of Yiddish. But now the District is set to revert to Alaskan control, and their dream is coming to an end. Homicide detective Meyer Landsman of the District Police has enough problems without worrying about the upcoming Reversion. His life is a shambles, his marriage a wreck, his career a disaster. And in the cheap hotel where Landsman has washed up, someone has just committed a murder—right under his nose. When he begins to investigate the killing of his neighbor, a former chess prodigy, word comes down from on high that the case is to be dropped immediately, and Landsman finds himself contending with all the powerful forces of faith, obsession, evil, and salvation that are his heritage. At once a gripping whodunit, a love story, and an exploration of the mysteries of exile and redemption, The Yiddish Policemen's Union is a novel only Michael Chabon could have written.",464,"Fiction","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QiKNDnFagiAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QiKNDnFagiAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=QiKNDnFagiAC&pg=PP1&dq=search+terms&hl=&cd=736&source=gbs_api","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QiKNDnFagiAC&source=gbs_api","A Novel",3.5,48

When I almost died it was just after midday."" When the Taliban took control of the Swat Valley in Pakistan, one girl spoke out. Malala Yousafzai refused to be silenced and fought for her right to an education. On Tuesday, October 9, 2012, when she was fifteen, she almost paid the ultimate price. She was shot in the head at point-blank range while riding the bus home from school, and few expected her to survive. Instead, Malala's miraculous recovery has taken her on an extraordinary journey from a remote valley in northern Pakistan to the halls of the United Nations in New York. At sixteen, she became a global symbol of peaceful protest and the youngest nominee ever for the Nobel Peace Prize. I AM MALALA is the remarkable tale of a family uprooted by global terrorism, of the fight for girls' education, of a father who, himself a school owner, championed and encouraged his daughter to write and attend school, and of brave parents who have a fierce love for their daughter in a society that prizes sons.

When they are exported, they can act as a means of communication or domination. However, there is no guarantee that the intentions of the producer will be recognized, much less respected, by the consumer from another culture. Cross-Cultural Consumption is a fascinating guide to the cultural implications of the globalization of a consumer society. The chapters address topics ranging from the clothing of colonial subjects in South Africa and the rise of the hypermarket in Argentina, to the presentation of culture in international tourist hotels. Through their examination of cultural imperialism and cultural appropriation of the representation of otherness and identity, Howes and his contributors show how the increasingly global flow of goods and images challenges the very idea of the cultural border and creates new spaces for cultural invention.

"_RECrgEACAAJ","It's a Wonderful Death","Sarah J. Schmitt","Sky Pony","10/6/15","Seventeen-year-old RJ always gets what she wants. So when her soul is accidentally collected by a distracted Grim Reaper, somebody in the afterlife better figure out a way to send her back from the dead or heads will roll. But in her quest for mortality, she becomes a pawn in a power struggle between an overzealous archangel and Death Himself. The tribunal presents her with two options: she can remain in the lobby, where souls wait to be processed, until her original lifeline expires, or she can replay three moments in her life in an effort to make choices that will result in a future deemed worthy of being saved. It sounds like a no-brainer. She’ll take a walk down memory lane. How hard can changing her future be? But with each changing moment, RJ’s life begins to unravel, until this self-proclaimed queen bee is a social pariah. She begins to wonder if walking among the living is worth it if she has to spend the next sixty years as an outcast. Too quickly, RJ finds herself back in limbo, her time on Earth once again up for debate. RJ is a snarky, unapologetic, almost unredeemable, very real girl. Her story is funny and moving, and teens will easily connect with her plight. Prepare to meet the Grim Reaper, who’s cuter than you’d expect; Hawaiian shirt–wearing Death Himself; Saint Peter (who likes to play Cornhole); and Al, the handler for the three-headed hound that guards the gates of Hell. This cast of characters accompanies RJ through her time in the afterlife and will do their best to gently shove her in the right direction.

It investigates social and emotional resilience and wellbeing in relation to developing protective factors against the impacts of cyberbullying and contains a range of perspectives to deal positively with cyberbullying as well as a summary of international research. Cyberbullying occurs when any means of technology is used to repeatedly and deliberately engage in bullying behaviours with the intent to cause harm to others. Although anyone can be affected, young people who are also being bullied offline are more likely to be the target of cyberbullying. Forms of cyberbullying include: • abusive texts and emails • posting messages or images • imitating and excluding others online • inappropriate image tagging. Cyberbullying differs from face-to-face bullying. • a sense of anonymity for those who bully • can occur 24/7 and is invasive • can have a large audience • difficult to delete comments and images.",0,"Education","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GWCengEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GWCengEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=GWCengEACAAJ&dq=search+terms&hl=&cd=927&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books?id=GWCengEACAAJ&dq=search+terms&hl=&source=gbs_api","",NA,0
"VoeNAQAACAAJ","Habits of Grace (Pack of 25)","","Good News Publishers","4/30/17","Our God is lavish in his grace. He's free to liberally dispense his goodness without the least bit of cooperation or preparation on our part, and often he does. But he also has regular channels through which he pours out his favor. These are sometimes called ""spiritual disciplines"" or ""means of grace."" We as Christians can routinely avail ourselves of these revealed paths of blessing, positioning ourselves to go on getting as God keeps on giving. His regular channels of grace are his voice, his ear, and his body--the Bible, prayer, and fellowship. The greatest grace along these paths is knowing and enjoying Jesus himself. HEARING GOD'S VOICE The fundamental means of God's ongoing grace, through his Spirit, in the life of the Christian and the life of the church is God's self-expression in his Word, in the gospel, perfectly kept for us and on display in all its textures, riches, and hues in the external written word of the Scriptures. The Bible is for us. The whole Bible is for the whole church. There's simply no replacement for finding a regular time and place, blocking out distractions, and letting your mind and heart be led and captured and thrilled by God himself communicating through his objective written words. As you read, learn to linger over a text, whether seeking to better understand it (""study""), or to emotionally glory in that understanding (""meditation""), or to memorize a portion to help renew your mind throughout the day. As we understand and engage with Scripture's meaning, we refocus our souls for living out our day. We increasingly ""have the mind of Christ"" (1 Corinthians 2:16) as we're conformed to his image. HAVING GOD'S EAR As we go deep in God's revelation, taking it into our very souls and being changed by his truth, we respond to him in prayer. God not only bids us hear his voice; he wants to hear ours. Prayer, for the Christian, is not merely talking to God, but responding to the One who has initiated toward us. He has spoken first. This is not a conversation we start, but a relationship into which we've been drawn. Prayer makes its requests of God, but is not content to only receive from God. Prayer must have him. Prayer is ultimately about having more of God. Private prayer shows who we really are spiritually. It's essential in healing the many places we find ourselves broken, needy, lacking, and rebellious. Prayer changes hearts like nothing else. It's for all of life, and especially for our life together in community. Praying together adds power to the request, but also means more glory for the Giver when he answers. BELONGING TO HIS BODY We were made to worship Jesus together. Corporate worship is the single most important means of grace and our greatest weapon in the fight for joy. More than any other means, corporate worship combines all three principles of God's ongoing grace: his word, prayer, and fellowship. In corporate worship, our focus together is the crucified and risen Christ and the incomparable excellencies of his person and work. We experience the secret of worship--the joy of self-forgetfulness--as we become preoccupied together with Jesus and his manifold perfections. In our gatherings for corporate worship, hearing the fresh preaching of the gospel from the Scriptures is the climactic grace. It's that moment among the assembled church when God speaks most clearly and completely. In faithful Christian preaching, we not only hear about Jesus, but we meet him. The act of preaching itself is a picture of the gospel. As the preacher stands behind the Book, doing his level best to reveal Jesus afresh to his people, our Lord is put on display. When we listen, we realize that what we need is not some boost from a trusted fellow to get us over the wall, but the rescue of the Savior for the utterly helpless. And so Jesus was sent not only to die as the remedy, but to preach (Luke 4:43). Jesus himself is the person the Scriptures most often refer to as preaching. Jesus was the ultimate preacher, but after his ascension, the preaching doesn't disappear. When we turn to Acts in the Bible, preaching is alive and well as ever. The preaching of the Groom [Jesus] extends into the life of the church. GRACE WILD AND FREE In considering these means of grace and the habits that help us go on receiving God's grace in our lives, this much must be made clear: These things are never about earning God's favor. God's grace is unmeasured, boundless, wild--and free. Because of it, we're enabled to repent of our sins and to believe God's promises. It is grace to be forgiven of sinful acts and grace to be supplied the heart for righteous ones. It is grace that we are increasingly ""conformed to the image of his Son"" (Romans 8:29), and grace that he doesn't leave us in the misery of our sin but pledges to bring to completion the good work he has begun in us (Philippians 1:6). This flood of God's favor brings us his forgiveness and our adoption as his children. It starts us on the path of grace-empowered effort and initiative. Have you taken the first step on this journey?",NA,"","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VoeNAQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VoeNAQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=VoeNAQAACAAJ&dq=search+terms&hl=&cd=928&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books?id=VoeNAQAACAAJ&dq=search+terms&hl=&source=gbs_api","",NA,0

"8upYzQEACAAJ","Accelerating Modernization with Agile Integration","Adeline Chun","","2020","The organization pursuing digital transformation must embrace new ways to use and deploy integration technologies, so they can move quickly in a manner appropriate to the goals of multicloud, decentralization, and microservices. The integration layer must transform to allow organizations to move boldly in building new customer experiences, rather than forcing models for architecture and development that pull away from maximizing the organization's productivity. Many organizations have started embracing agile application techniques, such as microservice architecture, and are now seeing the benefits of that shift. This approach complements and accelerates an enterprise's API strategy. Businesses should also seek to use this approach to modernize their existing integration and messaging infrastructure to achieve more effective ways to manage and operate their integration services in their private or public cloud. This IBM® Redbooks® publication explores the merits of what we refer to as agile integration; a container-based, decentralized, and microservice-aligned approach for integration solutions that meets the demands of agility, scalability, and resilience required by digital transformation. It also discusses how the IBM Cloud Pak for Integration marks a significant leap forward in integration technology by embracing both a cloud-native approach and container technology to achieve the goals of agile integration. The target audiences for this book are cloud integration architects, IT specialists, and application developers.",650,"","","","en","http://books.google.com/books?id=8upYzQEACAAJ&dq=search+terms&hl=&cd=952&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books?id=8upYzQEACAAJ&dq=search+terms&hl=&source=gbs_api","",NA,0
