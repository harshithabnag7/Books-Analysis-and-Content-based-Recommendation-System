FQAS is the premier conference concerned with the very important issue of providing users of information systems with ?exible querying capabilities, and withaneasyandintuitiveaccesstoinformation.Themainobjectiveistoachieve more expressive, informative, cooperative, and productive systems which faci- tate retrieval from information repositories such as databases, libraries, hete- geneous archives and the World-Wide Web. In targeting this objective, the c- ference draws on several research areas, such as information retrieval, database management, information ?ltering, knowledge representation, soft computing, management of multimedia information, and human–computer interaction. The conference provides a unique opportunity for researchers, developers and pr- titioners to explore new ideas and approaches in a multidisciplinary forum. The overalltopic of the FQAS conferences is innovative query systems aimed at providing easy, ?exible and human-friendly access to information.

There is an enormous interest in making the data in these sources easily accessible. There are primarily two general approaches to achieve this objective. The first is to surface the contents of these sources from the deep Web and add the contents to the index of regular search engines. The second is to integrate the searching capabilities of these sources and support integrated access to them. In this book, we introduce the state-of-the-art techniques for extracting, understanding, and integrating the query interfaces of deep Web data sources. These techniques are critical for producing an integrated query interface for each domain. The interface serves as the mediator for searching all data sources in the concerned domain. While query interface integration is only relevant for the deep Web integration approach, the extraction and understanding of query interfaces are critical for both deep Web exploration approaches. This book aims to provide in-depth and comprehensive coverage of the key technologies needed to create high quality integrated query interfaces automatically. The following technical issues are discussed in detail in this book: query interface modeling, query interface extraction, query interface clustering, query interface matching, query interface attribute integration, and query interface integration.

There is an enormous interest in making the data in these sources easily accessible. There are primarily two general approaches to achieve this objective. The first is to surface the contents of these sources from the deep Web and add the contents to the index of regular search engines. The second is to integrate the searching capabilities of these sources and support integrated access to them. In this book, we introduce the state-of-the-art techniques for extracting, understanding, and integrating the query interfaces of deep Web data sources. These techniques are critical for producing an integrated query interface for each domain. The interface serves as the mediator for searching all data sources in the concerned domain. While query interface integration is only relevant for the deep Web integration approach, the extraction and understanding of query interfaces are critical for both deep Web exploration approaches. This book aims to provide in-depth and comprehensive coverage of the key technologies needed to create high quality integrated query interfaces automatically. The following technical issues are discussed in detail in this book: query interface modeling, query interface extraction, query interface clustering, query interface matching, query interface attribute integration, and query interface integration.

There is an enormous interest in making the data in these sources easily accessible. There are primarily two general approaches to achieve this objective. The first is to surface the contents of these sources from the deep Web and add the contents to the index of regular search engines. The second is to integrate the searching capabilities of these sources and support integrated access to them. In this book, we introduce the state-of-the-art techniques for extracting, understanding, and integrating the query interfaces of deep Web data sources. These techniques are critical for producing an integrated query interface for each domain. The interface serves as the mediator for searching all data sources in the concerned domain. While query interface integration is only relevant for the deep Web integration approach, the extraction and understanding of query interfaces are critical for both deep Web exploration approaches. This book aims to provide in-depth and comprehensive coverage of the key technologies needed to create high quality integrated query interfaces automatically. The following technical issues are discussed in detail in this book: query interface modeling, query interface extraction, query interface clustering, query interface matching, query interface attribute integration, and query interface integration.

       "6 There are millions of searchable data sources on the Web and to a large extent their contents can only be reached through their own query interfaces. There is an enormous interest in making the data in these sources easily accessible. There are primarily two general approaches to achieve this objective. The first is to surface the contents of these sources from the deep Web and add the contents to the index of regular search engines. The second is to integrate the searching capabilities of these sources and support integrated access to them. In this book, we introduce the state-of-the-art techniques for extracting, understanding, and integrating the query interfaces of deep Web data sources. These techniques are critical for producing an integrated query interface for each domain. The interface serves as the mediator for searching all data sources in the concerned domain. While query interface integration is only relevant for the deep Web integration approach, the extraction and understanding of query interfaces are critical for both deep Web exploration approaches. This book aims to provide in-depth and comprehensive coverage of the key technologies needed to create high quality integrated query interfaces automatically. The following technical issues are discussed in detail in this book: query interface modeling, query interface extraction, query interface clustering, query interface matching, query interface attribute integration, and query interface integration.

FQAS 2009 was preceded by the 1994, 1996 and 1998 editions held in Roskilde, Denmark, the FQAS 2000 held in Warsaw, Poland, the 2002 held in Copenhagen, Denmark, and the 2004 and 2006 editions held in Lyon, France, and in Milan, Italy, respectively. FQAS is the premier conference concerned with the very important issue of providing users of information systems with ?exible querying capabilities, and withaneasyandintuitiveaccesstoinformation.Themainobjectiveistoachieve more expressive, informative, cooperative, and productive systems which faci- tate retrieval from information repositories such as databases, libraries, hete- geneous archives and the World-Wide Web. In targeting this objective, the c- ference draws on several research areas, such as information retrieval, database management, information ?ltering, knowledge representation, soft computing, management of multimedia information, and human–computer interaction. The conference provides a unique opportunity for researchers, developers and pr- titioners to explore new ideas and approaches in a multidisciplinary forum. The overalltopic of the FQAS conferences is innovative query systems aimed at providing easy, ?exible and human-friendly access to information. Such s- tems arebecoming increasinglyimportantalsodue to the huge andalwaysgr- ing number of users as well as the growing amount of available information.                                                                                                                                                                                      </span></td><td>688</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Computers     </span></td><td>http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gqDf__ULmR8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api</td><td>http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gqDf__ULmR8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=1&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api</td><td>en</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>http://books.google.com/books?id=gqDf__ULmR8C&amp;pg=PA180&amp;dq=search+terms&amp;hl=&amp;cd=2&amp;source=gbs_api           </span></td><td>http://books.google.com/books?id=gqDf__ULmR8C&amp;dq=search+terms&amp;hl=&amp;source=gbs_api</td><td>8th International Conference, FQAS 2009, Roskilde, Denmark, October 26-28, 2009, Proceedings</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>\n",

There is an enormous interest in making the data in these sources easily accessible. There are primarily two general approaches to achieve this objective. The first is to surface the contents of these sources from the deep Web and add the contents to the index of regular search engines. The second is to integrate the searching capabilities of these sources and support integrated access to them. In this book, we introduce the state-of-the-art techniques for extracting, understanding, and integrating the query interfaces of deep Web data sources. These techniques are critical for producing an integrated query interface for each domain. The interface serves as the mediator for searching all data sources in the concerned domain. While query interface integration is only relevant for the deep Web integration approach, the extraction and understanding of query interfaces are critical for both deep Web exploration approaches. This book aims to provide in-depth and comprehensive coverage of the key technologies needed to create high quality integrated query interfaces automatically. The following technical issues are discussed in detail in this book: query interface modeling, query interface extraction, query interface clustering, query interface matching, query interface attribute integration, and query interface integration.

Power Query, part of the Microsoft Power BI suite, is a tool that automates the process of getting data into Excel and will save you hours of dull, repetitive, and error-prone work! Power Query makes it easy to extract data from many different data sources, filter that data, aggregate it, clean it and perform calculations on it, finally loading that data into either your worksheet or directly into the new Excel 2013 Data Model used by Power Pivot. This concise, practical book provides a complete guide to Power Query and how to use it to solve all of your Excel data-loading problems. Power Query for Power BI and Excel goes well beyond the surface of what Power Query can do. The book goes deep into the underlying M language, showing you how to do amazing things that aren’t going to be possible from just the GUI interface that is covered in most other books. You’ll have full command of the GUI, and you’ll be able to drop into the M language to go beyond what the GUI provides. The depth in this book makes it a must-have item for anyone who is pushing Power BI and Excel to their limits in the pursuit of business intelligence from data analysis.

There is an enormous interest in making the data in these sources easily accessible. There are primarily two general approaches to achieve this objective. The first is to surface the contents of these sources from the deep Web and add the contents to the index of regular search engines. The second is to integrate the searching capabilities of these sources and support integrated access to them. In this book, we introduce the state-of-the-art techniques for extracting, understanding, and integrating the query interfaces of deep Web data sources. These techniques are critical for producing an integrated query interface for each domain. The interface serves as the mediator for searching all data sources in the concerned domain. While query interface integration is only relevant for the deep Web integration approach, the extraction and understanding of query interfaces are critical for both deep Web exploration approaches. This book aims to provide in-depth and comprehensive coverage of the key technologies needed to create high quality integrated query interfaces automatically. The following technical issues are discussed in detail in this book: query interface modeling, query interface extraction, query interface clustering, query interface matching, query interface attribute integration, and query interface integration.

Yu                                                       | Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers      | 2012     | There are millions of searchable data sources on the Web and to a large extent their contents can only be reached through their own query interfaces. There is an enormous interest in making the data in these sources easily accessible. There are primarily two general approaches to achieve this objective. The first is to surface the contents of these sources from the deep Web and add the contents to the index of regular search engines. The second is to integrate the searching capabilities of these sources and support integrated access to them. In this book, we introduce the state-of-the-art techniques for extracting, understanding, and integrating the query interfaces of deep Web data sources. These techniques are critical for producing an integrated query interface for each domain. The interface serves as the mediator for searching all data sources in the concerned domain. While query interface integration is only relevant for the deep Web integration approach, the extraction and understanding of query interfaces are critical for both deep Web exploration approaches. This book aims to provide in-depth and comprehensive coverage of the key technologies needed to create high quality integrated query interfaces automatically. The following technical issues are discussed in detail in this book: query interface modeling, query interface extraction, query interface clustering, query interface matching, query interface attribute integration, and query interface integration.

       "6 There are millions of searchable data sources on the Web and to a large extent their contents can only be reached through their own query interfaces. There is an enormous interest in making the data in these sources easily accessible. There are primarily two general approaches to achieve this objective. The first is to surface the contents of these sources from the deep Web and add the contents to the index of regular search engines. The second is to integrate the searching capabilities of these sources and support integrated access to them. In this book, we introduce the state-of-the-art techniques for extracting, understanding, and integrating the query interfaces of deep Web data sources. These techniques are critical for producing an integrated query interface for each domain. The interface serves as the mediator for searching all data sources in the concerned domain. While query interface integration is only relevant for the deep Web integration approach, the extraction and understanding of query interfaces are critical for both deep Web exploration approaches. This book aims to provide in-depth and comprehensive coverage of the key technologies needed to create high quality integrated query interfaces automatically. The following technical issues are discussed in detail in this book: query interface modeling, query interface extraction, query interface clustering, query interface matching, query interface attribute integration, and query interface integration.

FQAS is the premier conference concerned with the very important issue of providing users of information systems with ?exible querying capabilities, and withaneasyandintuitiveaccesstoinformation.Themainobjectiveistoachieve more expressive, informative, cooperative, and productive systems which faci- tate retrieval from information repositories such as databases, libraries, hete- geneous archives and the World-Wide Web. In targeting this objective, the c- ference draws on several research areas, such as information retrieval, database management, information ?ltering, knowledge representation, soft computing, management of multimedia information, and human–computer interaction. The conference provides a unique opportunity for researchers, developers and pr- titioners to explore new ideas and approaches in a multidisciplinary forum. The overalltopic of the FQAS conferences is innovative query systems aimed at providing easy, ?exible and human-friendly access to information.

There is an enormous interest in making the data in these sources easily accessible. There are primarily two general approaches to achieve this objective. The first is to surface the contents of these sources from the deep Web and add the contents to the index of regular search engines. The second is to integrate the searching capabilities of these sources and support integrated access to them. In this book, we introduce the state-of-the-art techniques for extracting, understanding, and integrating the query interfaces of deep Web data sources. These techniques are critical for producing an integrated query interface for each domain. The interface serves as the mediator for searching all data sources in the concerned domain. While query interface integration is only relevant for the deep Web integration approach, the extraction and understanding of query interfaces are critical for both deep Web exploration approaches. This book aims to provide in-depth and comprehensive coverage of the key technologies needed to create high quality integrated query interfaces automatically. The following technical issues are discussed in detail in this book: query interface modeling, query interface extraction, query interface clustering, query interface matching, query interface attribute integration, and query interface integration.

Power Query, part of the Microsoft Power BI suite, is a tool that automates the process of getting data into Excel and will save you hours of dull, repetitive, and error-prone work! Power Query makes it easy to extract data from many different data sources, filter that data, aggregate it, clean it and perform calculations on it, finally loading that data into either your worksheet or directly into the new Excel 2013 Data Model used by Power Pivot. This concise, practical book provides a complete guide to Power Query and how to use it to solve all of your Excel data-loading problems. Power Query for Power BI and Excel goes well beyond the surface of what Power Query can do. The book goes deep into the underlying M language, showing you how to do amazing things that aren’t going to be possible from just the GUI interface that is covered in most other books.

Yu                                                       & Morgan \\& Claypool Publishers      & 2012     & There are millions of searchable data sources on the Web and to a large extent their contents can only be reached through their own query interfaces. There is an enormous interest in making the data in these sources easily accessible. There are primarily two general approaches to achieve this objective. The first is to surface the contents of these sources from the deep Web and add the contents to the index of regular search engines. The second is to integrate the searching capabilities of these sources and support integrated access to them. In this book, we introduce the state-of-the-art techniques for extracting, understanding, and integrating the query interfaces of deep Web data sources. These techniques are critical for producing an integrated query interface for each domain. The interface serves as the mediator for searching all data sources in the concerned domain. While query interface integration is only relevant for the deep Web integration approach, the extraction and understanding of query interfaces are critical for both deep Web exploration approaches. This book aims to provide in-depth and comprehensive coverage of the key technologies needed to create high quality integrated query interfaces automatically. The following technical issues are discussed in detail in this book: query interface modeling, query interface extraction, query interface clustering, query interface matching, query interface attribute integration, and query interface integration.

Power Query, part of the Microsoft Power BI suite, is a tool that automates the process of getting data into Excel and will save you hours of dull, repetitive, and error-prone work! Power Query makes it easy to extract data from many different data sources, filter that data, aggregate it, clean it and perform calculations on it, finally loading that data into either your worksheet or directly into the new Excel 2013 Data Model used by Power Pivot. This concise, practical book provides a complete guide to Power Query and how to use it to solve all of your Excel data-loading problems. Power Query for Power BI and Excel goes well beyond the surface of what Power Query can do. The book goes deep into the underlying M language, showing you how to do amazing things that aren’t going to be possible from just the GUI interface that is covered in most other books.

The 60 revised full papers presented were carefully reviewed and selected from numerous submissions. The papers are organized in topical sections on flexibility in database management and quering, vagueness and uncertainty in XML quering and retrieval, information retrieval and filtering, multimedia information access, user modeling and personalization, knowledge and data extraction, intelligent information extraction from text, and knowledge representation and reasoning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 730 | Computers      | http://books.google.com/books/content?id=g7YNeVDDbVgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api | http://books.google.com/books/content?id=g7YNeVDDbVgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=1&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api | en | http://books.google.com/books?id=g7YNeVDDbVgC&amp;pg=PA582&amp;dq=search+terms&amp;hl=&amp;cd=5&amp;source=gbs_api            | http://books.google.com/books?id=g7YNeVDDbVgC&amp;dq=search+terms&amp;hl=&amp;source=gbs_api | 7th International Conference, FQAS 2006, Milan, Italy, June 7-10, 2006                       | 0 | 0 |\n",

Yu                                                       | Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers      | 2012     | There are millions of searchable data sources on the Web and to a large extent their contents can only be reached through their own query interfaces. There is an enormous interest in making the data in these sources easily accessible. There are primarily two general approaches to achieve this objective. The first is to surface the contents of these sources from the deep Web and add the contents to the index of regular search engines. The second is to integrate the searching capabilities of these sources and support integrated access to them. In this book, we introduce the state-of-the-art techniques for extracting, understanding, and integrating the query interfaces of deep Web data sources. These techniques are critical for producing an integrated query interface for each domain. The interface serves as the mediator for searching all data sources in the concerned domain. While query interface integration is only relevant for the deep Web integration approach, the extraction and understanding of query interfaces are critical for both deep Web exploration approaches. This book aims to provide in-depth and comprehensive coverage of the key technologies needed to create high quality integrated query interfaces automatically. The following technical issues are discussed in detail in this book: query interface modeling, query interface extraction, query interface clustering, query interface matching, query interface attribute integration, and query interface integration.

FQAS is the premier conference concerned with the very important issue of providing users of information systems with ?exible querying capabilities, and withaneasyandintuitiveaccesstoinformation.Themainobjectiveistoachieve more expressive, informative, cooperative, and productive systems which faci- tate retrieval from information repositories such as databases, libraries, hete- geneous archives and the World-Wide Web. In targeting this objective, the c- ference draws on several research areas, such as information retrieval, database management, information ?ltering, knowledge representation, soft computing, management of multimedia information, and human–computer interaction. The conference provides a unique opportunity for researchers, developers and pr- titioners to explore new ideas and approaches in a multidisciplinary forum. The overalltopic of the FQAS conferences is innovative query systems aimed at providing easy, ?exible and human-friendly access to information.

       "6 There are millions of searchable data sources on the Web and to a large extent their contents can only be reached through their own query interfaces. There is an enormous interest in making the data in these sources easily accessible. There are primarily two general approaches to achieve this objective. The first is to surface the contents of these sources from the deep Web and add the contents to the index of regular search engines. The second is to integrate the searching capabilities of these sources and support integrated access to them. In this book, we introduce the state-of-the-art techniques for extracting, understanding, and integrating the query interfaces of deep Web data sources. These techniques are critical for producing an integrated query interface for each domain. The interface serves as the mediator for searching all data sources in the concerned domain. While query interface integration is only relevant for the deep Web integration approach, the extraction and understanding of query interfaces are critical for both deep Web exploration approaches. This book aims to provide in-depth and comprehensive coverage of the key technologies needed to create high quality integrated query interfaces automatically. The following technical issues are discussed in detail in this book: query interface modeling, query interface extraction, query interface clustering, query interface matching, query interface attribute integration, and query interface integration.

There is an enormous interest in making the data in these sources easily accessible. There are primarily two general approaches to achieve this objective. The first is to surface the contents of these sources from the deep Web and add the contents to the index of regular search engines. The second is to integrate the searching capabilities of these sources and support integrated access to them. In this book, we introduce the state-of-the-art techniques for extracting, understanding, and integrating the query interfaces of deep Web data sources. These techniques are critical for producing an integrated query interface for each domain. The interface serves as the mediator for searching all data sources in the concerned domain. While query interface integration is only relevant for the deep Web integration approach, the extraction and understanding of query interfaces are critical for both deep Web exploration approaches.

This invaluable guide provides step-by-step instructions for investigating Internet crimes, including locating, interpreting, understanding, collecting, and documenting online electronic evidence to benefit investigations. Cybercrime is the fastest growing area of crime as more criminals seek to exploit the speed, convenience and anonymity that the Internet provides to commit a diverse range of criminal activities. Today's online crime includes attacks against computer data and systems, identity theft, distribution of child pornography, penetration of online financial services, using social networks to commit crimes, and the deployment of viruses, botnets, and email scams such as phishing. Symantec's 2012 Norton Cybercrime Report stated that the world spent an estimated $110 billion to combat cybercrime, an average of nearly $200 per victim. Law enforcement agencies and corporate security officers around the world with the responsibility for enforcing, investigating and prosecuting cybercrime are overwhelmed, not only by the sheer number of crimes being committed but by a lack of adequate training material.

In targeting this objective, the c- ference draws on several research areas, such as information retrieval, database management, information ?ltering, knowledge representation, soft computing, management of multimedia information, and human–computer interaction. The conference provides a unique opportunity for researchers, developers and pr- titioners to explore new ideas and approaches in a multidisciplinary forum. The overalltopic of the FQAS conferences is innovative query systems aimed at providing easy, ?exible and human-friendly access to information.

There is an enormous interest in making the data in these sources easily accessible. There are primarily two general approaches to achieve this objective. The first is to surface the contents of these sources from the deep Web and add the contents to the index of regular search engines. The second is to integrate the searching capabilities of these sources and support integrated access to them. In this book, we introduce the state-of-the-art techniques for extracting, understanding, and integrating the query interfaces of deep Web data sources. These techniques are critical for producing an integrated query interface for each domain. The interface serves as the mediator for searching all data sources in the concerned domain. While query interface integration is only relevant for the deep Web integration approach, the extraction and understanding of query interfaces are critical for both deep Web exploration approaches. This book aims to provide in-depth and comprehensive coverage of the key technologies needed to create high quality integrated query interfaces automatically.

This invaluable guide provides step-by-step instructions for investigating Internet crimes, including locating, interpreting, understanding, collecting, and documenting online electronic evidence to benefit investigations. Cybercrime is the fastest growing area of crime as more criminals seek to exploit the speed, convenience and anonymity that the Internet provides to commit a diverse range of criminal activities. Today's online crime includes attacks against computer data and systems, identity theft, distribution of child pornography, penetration of online financial services, using social networks to commit crimes, and the deployment of viruses, botnets, and email scams such as phishing. Symantec's 2012 Norton Cybercrime Report stated that the world spent an estimated \\$110 billion to combat cybercrime, an average of nearly \\$200 per victim. Law enforcement agencies and corporate security officers around the world with the responsibility for enforcing, investigating and prosecuting cybercrime are overwhelmed, not only by the sheer number of crimes being committed but by a lack of adequate training material. This book provides that fundamental knowledge, including how to properly collect and document online evidence, trace IP addresses, and work undercover.

The papers are organized in topical sections on flexibility in database management and quering, vagueness and uncertainty in XML quering and retrieval, information retrieval and filtering, multimedia information access, user modeling and personalization, knowledge and data extraction, intelligent information extraction from text, and knowledge representation and reasoning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 730 | Computers                                 | http://books.google.com/books/content?id=g7YNeVDDbVgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api | http://books.google.com/books/content?id=g7YNeVDDbVgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=1&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api | en | http://books.google.com/books?id=g7YNeVDDbVgC&amp;pg=PA582&amp;dq=search+terms&amp;hl=&amp;cd=5&amp;source=gbs_api             | http://books.google.com/books?id=g7YNeVDDbVgC&amp;dq=search+terms&amp;hl=&amp;source=gbs_api | 7th International Conference, FQAS 2006, Milan, Italy, June 7-10, 2006                       | 0 | 0 |\n",
       "| 6 | L0rrrfE0bOsC | Deep Web Query Interface Understanding and Integration  | Eduard C. Dragut, Weiyi Meng, Clement T. Yu                                                       | Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers      | 2012     | There are millions of searchable data sources on the Web and to a large extent their contents can only be reached through their own query interfaces. There is an enormous interest in making the data in these sources easily accessible. There are primarily two general approaches to achieve this objective. The first is to surface the contents of these sources from the deep Web and add the contents to the index of regular search engines. The second is to integrate the searching capabilities of these sources and support integrated access to them. In this book, we introduce the state-of-the-art techniques for extracting, understanding, and integrating the query interfaces of deep Web data sources. These techniques are critical for producing an integrated query interface for each domain. The interface serves as the mediator for searching all data sources in the concerned domain. While query interface integration is only relevant for the deep Web integration approach, the extraction and understanding of query interfaces are critical for both deep Web exploration approaches. This book aims to provide in-depth and comprehensive coverage of the key technologies needed to create high quality integrated query interfaces automatically. The following technical issues are discussed in detail in this book: query interface modeling, query interface extraction, query interface clustering, query interface matching, query interface attribute integration, and query interface integration.

This invaluable guide provides step-by-step instructions for investigating Internet crimes, including locating, interpreting, understanding, collecting, and documenting online electronic evidence to benefit investigations. Cybercrime is the fastest growing area of crime as more criminals seek to exploit the speed, convenience and anonymity that the Internet provides to commit a diverse range of criminal activities. Today's online crime includes attacks against computer data and systems, identity theft, distribution of child pornography, penetration of online financial services, using social networks to commit crimes, and the deployment of viruses, botnets, and email scams such as phishing. Symantec's 2012 Norton Cybercrime Report stated that the world spent an estimated $110 billion to combat cybercrime, an average of nearly $200 per victim. Law enforcement agencies and corporate security officers around the world with the responsibility for enforcing, investigating and prosecuting cybercrime are overwhelmed, not only by the sheer number of crimes being committed but by a lack of adequate training material. This book provides that fundamental knowledge, including how to properly collect and document online evidence, trace IP addresses, and work undercover.

       "6  There are millions of searchable data sources on the Web and to a large extent their contents can only be reached through their own query interfaces. There is an enormous interest in making the data in these sources easily accessible. There are primarily two general approaches to achieve this objective. The first is to surface the contents of these sources from the deep Web and add the contents to the index of regular search engines. The second is to integrate the searching capabilities of these sources and support integrated access to them. In this book, we introduce the state-of-the-art techniques for extracting, understanding, and integrating the query interfaces of deep Web data sources. These techniques are critical for producing an integrated query interface for each domain. The interface serves as the mediator for searching all data sources in the concerned domain. While query interface integration is only relevant for the deep Web integration approach, the extraction and understanding of query interfaces are critical for both deep Web exploration approaches. This book aims to provide in-depth and comprehensive coverage of the key technologies needed to create high quality integrated query interfaces automatically. The following technical issues are discussed in detail in this book: query interface modeling, query interface extraction, query interface clustering, query interface matching, query interface attribute integration, and query interface integration.

       "10 Whether your search is limited to a single database or is as expansive as all of cyberspace, you won't find the intended results unless you use the words that work. Now in its second edition, Sara Knapp has updated and expanded this invaluable resource. Unlike any other thesaurus available, this popular guide offers a wealth of natural language options in a convenient, A-to-Z format.

FQAS 2009 was preceded by the 1994, 1996 and 1998 editions held in Roskilde, Denmark, the FQAS 2000 held in Warsaw, Poland, the 2002 held in Copenhagen, Denmark, and the 2004 and 2006 editions held in Lyon, France, and in Milan, Italy, respectively. FQAS is the premier conference concerned with the very important issue of providing users of information systems with ?exible querying capabilities, and withaneasyandintuitiveaccesstoinformation.Themainobjectiveistoachieve more expressive, informative, cooperative, and productive systems which faci- tate retrieval from information repositories such as databases, libraries, hete- geneous archives and the World-Wide Web. In targeting this objective, the c- ference draws on several research areas, such as information retrieval, database management, information ?ltering, knowledge representation, soft computing, management of multimedia information, and human–computer interaction. The conference provides a unique opportunity for researchers, developers and pr- titioners to explore new ideas and approaches in a multidisciplinary forum. The overalltopic of the FQAS conferences is innovative query systems aimed at providing easy, ?exible and human-friendly access to information.

There is an enormous interest in making the data in these sources easily accessible. There are primarily two general approaches to achieve this objective. The first is to surface the contents of these sources from the deep Web and add the contents to the index of regular search engines. The second is to integrate the searching capabilities of these sources and support integrated access to them. In this book, we introduce the state-of-the-art techniques for extracting, understanding, and integrating the query interfaces of deep Web data sources. These techniques are critical for producing an integrated query interface for each domain. The interface serves as the mediator for searching all data sources in the concerned domain. While query interface integration is only relevant for the deep Web integration approach, the extraction and understanding of query interfaces are critical for both deep Web exploration approaches. This book aims to provide in-depth and comprehensive coverage of the key technologies needed to create high quality integrated query interfaces automatically. The following technical issues are discussed in detail in this book: query interface modeling, query interface extraction, query interface clustering, query interface matching, query interface attribute integration, and query interface integration.

This invaluable guide provides step-by-step instructions for investigating Internet crimes, including locating, interpreting, understanding, collecting, and documenting online electronic evidence to benefit investigations. Cybercrime is the fastest growing area of crime as more criminals seek to exploit the speed, convenience and anonymity that the Internet provides to commit a diverse range of criminal activities. Today's online crime includes attacks against computer data and systems, identity theft, distribution of child pornography, penetration of online financial services, using social networks to commit crimes, and the deployment of viruses, botnets, and email scams such as phishing. Symantec's 2012 Norton Cybercrime Report stated that the world spent an estimated $110 billion to combat cybercrime, an average of nearly $200 per victim. Law enforcement agencies and corporate security officers around the world with the responsibility for enforcing, investigating and prosecuting cybercrime are overwhelmed, not only by the sheer number of crimes being committed but by a lack of adequate training material. This book provides that fundamental knowledge, including how to properly collect and document online evidence, trace IP addresses, and work undercover.

These PnP interfaces are grounded in the principles of human-computer interaction (HCI) and cognitive psychology to address long-standing limitations to bottom-up search capabilities in graph databases using traditional graph query languages, which often require domain experts and specialist programmers. This book explains how PnP interfaces go against the traditional mantra of VQI construction by taking a data-driven approach and giving end users the freedom to easily and quickly construct and maintain a VQI for any data sources without resorting to coding. The book walks readers through the intuitive PnP interface that uses templates where the underlying graph repository represents the socket and user-specified requirements represent the plug. Hence, a PnP interface enables an end user to change the socket (i.e., graph repository) or the plug (i.e., requirements) as necessary to automatically and effortlessly generate VQIs. The book argues that such a data-driven paradigm creates several benefits, including superior support for visual subgraph query construction, significant reduction in the manual cost of constructing and maintaining a VQI for any graph data source, and portability of the interface across diverse sources and querying applications. This book provides a comprehensive introduction to the notion of PnP interfaces, compares it to its classical manual counterpart, and reviews techniques for automatic construction and maintenance of these new interfaces. In synthesizing current research on plug-and-play visual subgraph query interface management, this book gives readers a snapshot of the state of the art in this topic as well as future research directions.                                                                                                                                         </span></td><td> 182</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Computers                                </span></td><td>http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6nWzEAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api</td><td>http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6nWzEAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=1&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api</td><td>en</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>http://books.google.com/books?id=6nWzEAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=search+terms&amp;hl=&amp;cd=17&amp;source=gbs_api             </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6nWzEAAAQBAJ&amp;source=gbs_api      </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>                                                                                            </span></td><td>NA</td><td>0</td></tr>\n",

Clear, accessible explanations present reading concepts without oversimplifying the process of reading comprehension. To ensure students' understanding, reading keys or summaries follow the explanations, breaking them down into manageable chunks. Throughout each chapter, a variety of steadily more difficult exercises assess students' understanding of the material and promote improved comprehension and critical-thinking skills. This incremental approach to instruction and assessment makes it easier for beginning readers to absorb and master new information. The Fourth Edition includes new chapters on analyzing arguments and sentence relationships. In addition, there is a greater emphasis on recognizing and understanding verbal clues to meaning, new discussions on how the brain learns and remembers new information, and several new engaging readings.

This quote from the authors hints at the investigative power of the techniques this book teaches: Nothing I am going to describe to you is illegal, nor does it in any way involve accessing unauthorized data, [...but] involves using publicly available search engines to access publicly available information that almost certainly was not intended for public distribution. From search strings that will reveal secret documents from South Africa ( filetype: xls site: za confidential ) to tracking down tables of Russian passwords ( filetype: xls site: ru login ), this is both an instructive and voyeuristic look at how the most powerful spy agency in the world uses Google.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     </span></td><td> 650</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Computer network resources               </span></td><td>http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qLzoWKp2JHcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api</td><td>http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qLzoWKp2JHcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=1&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api</td><td>en</td><td>http://books.google.com/books?id=qLzoWKp2JHcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=search+terms&amp;hl=&amp;cd=20&amp;source=gbs_api</td><td>http://books.google.com/books?id=qLzoWKp2JHcC&amp;dq=search+terms&amp;hl=&amp;source=gbs_api</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>The NSA's Guide to Gathering Information on Google                                          </span></td><td> 1</td><td>1</td></tr>\n",

Then try this super-duper colossal collection of 365 searches—a full year’s worth of mind-melting puzzles that will (as a bonus) improve your vocabulary, too. Every page has TWO word searches on it, each with a cool theme, like \"File Extensions\" and \"Fountains\" or \"Jelly Beans\" and \"Letter Order.\" See how many \"Movie Stars\" (Damon, Diesel, Streep) catch your eye or fun \"Onomatopoeia\" words you can circle—boom, buzz, clang, click, gurgle, hiccup, honk. Experts who want something really challenging will find what they want here, too. \"Conifer\" includes such tree names as bristlecone, loblolly, and tamarack, while \"Quantum Mechanics\" offers bosons, fermions, and isobar. And for something a little unusual, there’s even a \"Minnesota Zip Code\" puzzle, where you look for groups of numbers. But the truly brain-busting ones come at the end of the book, when the puzzles veer from the standard to the really challenging, and some even have no word list at all. They’re hard, they’re tough . . . and they’re wildly entertaining!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>   0</span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Games &amp; Activities                       </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AuFKEAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;source=gbs_api          </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AuFKEAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=1&amp;source=gbs_api          </span></td><td>en</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>http://books.google.com/books?id=AuFKEAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=search+terms&amp;hl=&amp;cd=24&amp;source=gbs_api                    </span></td><td>http://books.google.com/books?id=AuFKEAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=search+terms&amp;hl=&amp;source=gbs_api</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>365 Great Puzzles                                                                           </span></td><td>NA</td><td>0</td></tr>\n",

It tells the story of the impact of one of the most significant technological breakthroughs in Japan in the latter part of this century: the invention and rapid adoption of word-processing technology capable of handling Japanese script in a society where the nature of that script had previously mandated handwriting as the norm. The ramifications of this technology in both the business and personal spheres have been wide-ranging, extending from changes to business practices, work profiles, orthography and social attitudes to writing through to Japan's ability to construct a substantial presence on the Internet in recent years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </span></td><td> 219</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Social Science                           </span></td><td>http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SYEnAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api</td><td>http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SYEnAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=1&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api</td><td>en</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>http://books.google.com/books?id=SYEnAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=search+terms&amp;hl=&amp;cd=25&amp;source=gbs_api            </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SYEnAAAAQBAJ&amp;source=gbs_api      </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Kanji and the Keyboard                                                                      </span></td><td>NA</td><td>0</td></tr>\n",

Since users are only intermittently connected to MSNets, user mobility should be exploited to bridge network partitions and forward data. Currently, data route/forward approaches for such intermittently connected networks are commonly \"store-carry-and-forward\" schemes, which exploit the physical user movements to carry data around the network and overcome path disconnection. And since the source and destination may be far away from each other, the delay for the destination to receive the data from the source may be long. MSNets can be viewed as one type of socially-aware delay tolerant networks (DTNs). Observed from social networks, the contact frequencies are probably different between two friends and two strangers, and this difference should be taken into consideration when designing data dissemination and query schemes in MSNets. In this book, the fundamental concepts of MSNets are introduced including the background, key features and potential applications of MSNets, while also presenting research topics, such as, MSNets as realistic social contact traces and user mobility models. Because the ultimate goal is to establish networks that allow mobile users to quickly and efficiently access interesting information, particular attention is paid to data dissemination and query schemes in subsequent sections. Combined with geography information, the concepts of community and centrality are employed from a social network perspective to propose several data dissemination and query schemes, and further use real social contact traces to evaluate their performance, demonstrating that such schemes achieve better performance when exploiting more social relationships between users.</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>  86</span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Computers                                </span></td><td>http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VQSikiO8IA0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api</td><td>http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VQSikiO8IA0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=1&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api</td><td>en</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>http://books.google.com/books?id=VQSikiO8IA0C&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=search+terms&amp;hl=&amp;cd=26&amp;source=gbs_api            </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VQSikiO8IA0C&amp;source=gbs_api      </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>                                                                                            </span></td><td>NA</td><td>0</td></tr>\n",

He's been practicing all summer and can't wait to see his classmates' faces when he beats them all. But on the first day of school, a new girl boldly crosses over to the boys' side and outruns everyone. That's not a very promising beginning for a friendship, but Jess and Leslie Burke become inseparable. Together they create Terabithia, a magical kingdom in the woods where the two of them reign as king and queen, and their imaginations set the only limits. Then one morning a terrible tragedy occurs. Only when Jess is able to come to grips with this tragedy does he finally understand the strength and courage Leslie has given him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </span></td><td> 212</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Juvenile Fiction         </span></td><td>http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LgLT04F1KscC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api</td><td>http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LgLT04F1KscC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=1&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api</td><td>en</td><td>http://books.google.com/books?id=LgLT04F1KscC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=search+terms&amp;hl=&amp;cd=938&amp;source=gbs_api</td><td>http://books.google.com/books?id=LgLT04F1KscC&amp;dq=search+terms&amp;hl=&amp;source=gbs_api</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>                                                                               </span></td><td>4.0</td><td>282</td></tr>\n",

In the run-up to the 2016 election, Owen Callahan, an aspiring writer, moves back to Kentucky to live with his Trump-supporting uncle and grandfather. Eager to clean up his act after wasting time and potential in his early twenties, he takes a job as a groundskeeper at a small local college, in exchange for which he is permitted to take a writing course. Here he meets Alma Hazdic, a writer in residence who seems to have everything that Owen lacks—a prestigious position, an Ivy League education, success as a writer. They begin a secret relationship, and as they grow closer, Alma—who comes from a liberal family of Bosnian immigrants—struggles to understand Owen’s fraught relationship with family and home.

They soon know that they will grow up, and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother. I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, \"Oh, why can't you remain like this for ever!\" This was all that passed between them on the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up.

The integration layer must transform to allow organizations to move boldly in building new customer experiences, rather than forcing models for architecture and development that pull away from maximizing the organization's productivity. Many organizations have started embracing agile application techniques, such as microservice architecture, and are now seeing the benefits of that shift. This approach complements and accelerates an enterprise's API strategy. Businesses should also seek to use this approach to modernize their existing integration and messaging infrastructure to achieve more effective ways to manage and operate their integration services in their private or public cloud. This IBM® Redbooks® publication explores the merits of what we refer to as agile integration; a container-based, decentralized, and microservice-aligned approach for integration solutions that meets the demands of agility, scalability, and resilience required by digital transformation. It also discusses how the IBM Cloud Pak for Integration marks a significant leap forward in integration technology by embracing both a cloud-native approach and container technology to achieve the goals of agile integration. The target audiences for this book are cloud integration architects, IT specialists, and application developers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </span></td><td> 650</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>                         </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>                                                                                                               </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>                                                                                                               </span></td><td>en</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>http://books.google.com/books?id=8upYzQEACAAJ&amp;dq=search+terms&amp;hl=&amp;cd=952&amp;source=gbs_api                    </span></td><td>http://books.google.com/books?id=8upYzQEACAAJ&amp;dq=search+terms&amp;hl=&amp;source=gbs_api</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>                                                                               </span></td><td> NA</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>  0</span></td></tr>\n",

Yu                                                       & Morgan \\& Claypool Publishers      & 2012     & There are millions of searchable data sources on the Web and to a large extent their contents can only be reached through their own query interfaces. There is an enormous interest in making the data in these sources easily accessible. There are primarily two general approaches to achieve this objective. The first is to surface the contents of these sources from the deep Web and add the contents to the index of regular search engines. The second is to integrate the searching capabilities of these sources and support integrated access to them. In this book, we introduce the state-of-the-art techniques for extracting, understanding, and integrating the query interfaces of deep Web data sources. These techniques are critical for producing an integrated query interface for each domain. The interface serves as the mediator for searching all data sources in the concerned domain. While query interface integration is only relevant for the deep Web integration approach, the extraction and understanding of query interfaces are critical for both deep Web exploration approaches. This book aims to provide in-depth and comprehensive coverage of the key technologies needed to create high quality integrated query interfaces automatically. The following technical issues are discussed in detail in this book: query interface modeling, query interface extraction, query interface clustering, query interface matching, query interface attribute integration, and query interface integration.

This invaluable guide provides step-by-step instructions for investigating Internet crimes, including locating, interpreting, understanding, collecting, and documenting online electronic evidence to benefit investigations. Cybercrime is the fastest growing area of crime as more criminals seek to exploit the speed, convenience and anonymity that the Internet provides to commit a diverse range of criminal activities. Today's online crime includes attacks against computer data and systems, identity theft, distribution of child pornography, penetration of online financial services, using social networks to commit crimes, and the deployment of viruses, botnets, and email scams such as phishing. Symantec's 2012 Norton Cybercrime Report stated that the world spent an estimated \\$110 billion to combat cybercrime, an average of nearly \\$200 per victim. Law enforcement agencies and corporate security officers around the world with the responsibility for enforcing, investigating and prosecuting cybercrime are overwhelmed, not only by the sheer number of crimes being committed but by a lack of adequate training material.

Bhowmick, Byron Choi                                                                    & Springer Nature                   & 4/17/23  & This book details recent developments in the emerging area of plug-and-play (PnP) visual subgraph query interfaces (VQI). These PnP interfaces are grounded in the principles of human-computer interaction (HCI) and cognitive psychology to address long-standing limitations to bottom-up search capabilities in graph databases using traditional graph query languages, which often require domain experts and specialist programmers. This book explains how PnP interfaces go against the traditional mantra of VQI construction by taking a data-driven approach and giving end users the freedom to easily and quickly construct and maintain a VQI for any data sources without resorting to coding. The book walks readers through the intuitive PnP interface that uses templates where the underlying graph repository represents the socket and user-specified requirements represent the plug. Hence, a PnP interface enables an end user to change the socket (i.e., graph repository) or the plug (i.e., requirements) as necessary to automatically and effortlessly generate VQIs. The book argues that such a data-driven paradigm creates several benefits, including superior support for visual subgraph query construction, significant reduction in the manual cost of constructing and maintaining a VQI for any graph data source, and portability of the interface across diverse sources and querying applications. This book provides a comprehensive introduction to the notion of PnP interfaces, compares it to its classical manual counterpart, and reviews techniques for automatic construction and maintenance of these new interfaces. In synthesizing current research on plug-and-play visual subgraph query interface management, this book gives readers a snapshot of the state of the art in this topic as well as future research directions.                                                                                                                                          &  182 & Computers                                 & http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6nWzEAAAQBAJ\\&printsec=frontcover\\&img=1\\&zoom=5\\&edge=curl\\&source=gbs\\_api & http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6nWzEAAAQBAJ\\&printsec=frontcover\\&img=1\\&zoom=1\\&edge=curl\\&source=gbs\\_api & en & http://books.google.com/books?id=6nWzEAAAQBAJ\\&pg=PR7\\&dq=search+terms\\&hl=\\&cd=17\\&source=gbs\\_api              & https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6nWzEAAAQBAJ\\&source=gbs\\_api       &                                                                                              & NA & 0\\\\\n",

Clear, accessible explanations present reading concepts without oversimplifying the process of reading comprehension. To ensure students' understanding, reading keys or summaries follow the explanations, breaking them down into manageable chunks. Throughout each chapter, a variety of steadily more difficult exercises assess students' understanding of the material and promote improved comprehension and critical-thinking skills. This incremental approach to instruction and assessment makes it easier for beginning readers to absorb and master new information. The Fourth Edition includes new chapters on analyzing arguments and sentence relationships. In addition, there is a greater emphasis on recognizing and understanding verbal clues to meaning, new discussions on how the brain learns and remembers new information, and several new engaging readings.

Then try this super-duper colossal collection of 365 searches—a full year’s worth of mind-melting puzzles that will (as a bonus) improve your vocabulary, too. Every page has TWO word searches on it, each with a cool theme, like \"File Extensions\" and \"Fountains\" or \"Jelly Beans\" and \"Letter Order.\" See how many \"Movie Stars\" (Damon, Diesel, Streep) catch your eye or fun \"Onomatopoeia\" words you can circle—boom, buzz, clang, click, gurgle, hiccup, honk. Experts who want something really challenging will find what they want here, too. \"Conifer\" includes such tree names as bristlecone, loblolly, and tamarack, while \"Quantum Mechanics\" offers bosons, fermions, and isobar. And for something a little unusual, there’s even a \"Minnesota Zip Code\" puzzle, where you look for groups of numbers. But the truly brain-busting ones come at the end of the book, when the puzzles veer from the standard to the really challenging, and some even have no word list at all. They’re hard, they’re tough . . . and they’re wildly entertaining!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            &    0 & Games \\& Activities                        & http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AuFKEAAAQBAJ\\&printsec=frontcover\\&img=1\\&zoom=5\\&source=gbs\\_api           & http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AuFKEAAAQBAJ\\&printsec=frontcover\\&img=1\\&zoom=1\\&source=gbs\\_api           & en & http://books.google.com/books?id=AuFKEAAAQBAJ\\&dq=search+terms\\&hl=\\&cd=24\\&source=gbs\\_api                     & http://books.google.com/books?id=AuFKEAAAQBAJ\\&dq=search+terms\\&hl=\\&source=gbs\\_api & 365 Great Puzzles                                                                            & NA & 0\\\\\n",

It tells the story of the impact of one of the most significant technological breakthroughs in Japan in the latter part of this century: the invention and rapid adoption of word-processing technology capable of handling Japanese script in a society where the nature of that script had previously mandated handwriting as the norm. The ramifications of this technology in both the business and personal spheres have been wide-ranging, extending from changes to business practices, work profiles, orthography and social attitudes to writing through to Japan's ability to construct a substantial presence on the Internet in recent years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        &  219 & Social Science                            & http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SYEnAAAAQBAJ\\&printsec=frontcover\\&img=1\\&zoom=5\\&edge=curl\\&source=gbs\\_api & http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SYEnAAAAQBAJ\\&printsec=frontcover\\&img=1\\&zoom=1\\&edge=curl\\&source=gbs\\_api & en & http://books.google.com/books?id=SYEnAAAAQBAJ\\&pg=PA78\\&dq=search+terms\\&hl=\\&cd=25\\&source=gbs\\_api             & https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SYEnAAAAQBAJ\\&source=gbs\\_api       & Kanji and the Keyboard                                                                       & NA & 0\\\\\n",

Since users are only intermittently connected to MSNets, user mobility should be exploited to bridge network partitions and forward data. Currently, data route/forward approaches for such intermittently connected networks are commonly \"store-carry-and-forward\" schemes, which exploit the physical user movements to carry data around the network and overcome path disconnection. And since the source and destination may be far away from each other, the delay for the destination to receive the data from the source may be long. MSNets can be viewed as one type of socially-aware delay tolerant networks (DTNs). Observed from social networks, the contact frequencies are probably different between two friends and two strangers, and this difference should be taken into consideration when designing data dissemination and query schemes in MSNets. In this book, the fundamental concepts of MSNets are introduced including the background, key features and potential applications of MSNets, while also presenting research topics, such as, MSNets as realistic social contact traces and user mobility models. Because the ultimate goal is to establish networks that allow mobile users to quickly and efficiently access interesting information, particular attention is paid to data dissemination and query schemes in subsequent sections. Combined with geography information, the concepts of community and centrality are employed from a social network perspective to propose several data dissemination and query schemes, and further use real social contact traces to evaluate their performance, demonstrating that such schemes achieve better performance when exploiting more social relationships between users. &   86 & Computers                                 & http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VQSikiO8IA0C\\&printsec=frontcover\\&img=1\\&zoom=5\\&edge=curl\\&source=gbs\\_api & http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VQSikiO8IA0C\\&printsec=frontcover\\&img=1\\&zoom=1\\&edge=curl\\&source=gbs\\_api & en & http://books.google.com/books?id=VQSikiO8IA0C\\&pg=PA75\\&dq=search+terms\\&hl=\\&cd=26\\&source=gbs\\_api             & https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VQSikiO8IA0C\\&source=gbs\\_api       &                                                                                              & NA & 0\\\\\n",

In three new short e-books, Melanie Mitchell takes you to the cutting edge of search engine optimization (SEO), demonstrating how to use powerful new techniques to achieve unprecedented results! In SEO \\& PPC: Better Together, Mitchell transcends the debate between SEO and pay-per-click, showing how to use them both together to achieve better results than either can deliver alone. You’ll learn how to integrate SEO and PPC in campaigns that engage more consumers than ever before and use data from both to improve the performance of each. Next, How to Make SEO Work for You completely demystifies SEO, showing you how to grab value from “low hanging fruit” and start optimizing everything from pages, text, and keywords to images–even your page’s underlying HTML code. Mitchell shows how to craft a strategy that reflects your specific goals for attracting qualified traffic; measure everything from the quality of visitor engagement to sales conversions; structure sites that are friendlier to both searchers and search engines; earn the honest links that search algorithms love; and much more. Finally, in Unleash the Power of Paid Search, Mitchell brings together the processes, knowledge, and tools you need to build and manage exceptionally successful paid search campaigns. Mitchell guides you through the entire process of building and executing a winning campaign: defining goals and objectives, selecting keywords and match types, structuring accounts, scoring quality, managing ad copy, optimizing landing pages, monitoring, reporting, and more. These eBooks draw on Mitchell’s immense “in-the -trenches” experience to illuminate concepts, terminology, and best practices you need now, whether you’re “doing it yourself” or working with specialists.                                                                                                              &   95 & Business \\& Economics                      & http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xXom9korRs4C\\&printsec=frontcover\\&img=1\\&zoom=5\\&edge=curl\\&source=gbs\\_api & http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xXom9korRs4C\\&printsec=frontcover\\&img=1\\&zoom=1\\&edge=curl\\&source=gbs\\_api & en & http://books.google.com/books?id=xXom9korRs4C\\&printsec=frontcover\\&dq=search+terms\\&hl=\\&cd=29\\&source=gbs\\_api & http://books.google.com/books?id=xXom9korRs4C\\&dq=search+terms\\&hl=\\&source=gbs\\_api & Expert Advice from Melanie Mitchell (Collection)                                             &  2 & 1\\\\\n",

Rayce is a wanted man and dangerously charismatic, the worst person for Rose to get involved with, no matter what his smile promises. But he assumes Rose's attempt to take him hostage is part of a plot to crush the rebellion, so he takes her ashis hostage.

Only when Jess is able to come to grips with this tragedy does he finally understand the strength and courage Leslie has given him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 &  212 & Juvenile Fiction          & http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LgLT04F1KscC\\&printsec=frontcover\\&img=1\\&zoom=5\\&edge=curl\\&source=gbs\\_api & http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LgLT04F1KscC\\&printsec=frontcover\\&img=1\\&zoom=1\\&edge=curl\\&source=gbs\\_api & en & http://books.google.com/books?id=LgLT04F1KscC\\&printsec=frontcover\\&dq=search+terms\\&hl=\\&cd=938\\&source=gbs\\_api & http://books.google.com/books?id=LgLT04F1KscC\\&dq=search+terms\\&hl=\\&source=gbs\\_api &                                                                                 & 4.0 & 282\\\\\n",

Important.” —Library Journal, starred review “A marvelous yarn, loaded with near-calamitous adventures and characters as memorable as Singer creations.” —The New York Post “What began as a quixotic journey was also a picaresque romp, a detective story, a profound history lesson, and a poignant evocation of a bygone world.” —The Boston Globe “Every now and again a book with near-universal appeal comes along: Outwitting History is just such a book.” —The Sunday Oregonian As a twenty-three-year-old graduate student, Aaron Lansky set out to save the world’s abandoned Yiddish books before it was too late. Today, more than a million books later, he has accomplished what has been called “the greatest cultural rescue effort in Jewish history.” In Outwitting History, Lansky shares his adventures as well as the poignant and often laugh-out-loud stories he heard as he traveled the country collecting books. Introducing us to a dazzling array of writers, he shows us how an almost-lost culture is the bridge between the old world and the future—and how the written word can unite everyone who believes in the power of great literature.

In the run-up to the 2016 election, Owen Callahan, an aspiring writer, moves back to Kentucky to live with his Trump-supporting uncle and grandfather. Eager to clean up his act after wasting time and potential in his early twenties, he takes a job as a groundskeeper at a small local college, in exchange for which he is permitted to take a writing course. Here he meets Alma Hazdic, a writer in residence who seems to have everything that Owen lacks—a prestigious position, an Ivy League education, success as a writer. They begin a secret relationship, and as they grow closer, Alma—who comes from a liberal family of Bosnian immigrants—struggles to understand Owen’s fraught relationship with family and home. Exquisitely written; expertly crafted; dazzling in its precision, restraint, and depth of feeling, Groundskeeping is a novel of haunting power and grace from a prodigiously gifted young writer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              &  337 & Fiction                   & http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PvaUEAAAQBAJ\\&printsec=frontcover\\&img=1\\&zoom=5\\&source=gbs\\_api           & http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PvaUEAAAQBAJ\\&printsec=frontcover\\&img=1\\&zoom=1\\&source=gbs\\_api           & en & http://books.google.com/books?id=PvaUEAAAQBAJ\\&pg=PP1\\&dq=search+terms\\&hl=\\&cd=946\\&source=gbs\\_api              & http://books.google.com/books?id=PvaUEAAAQBAJ\\&dq=search+terms\\&hl=\\&source=gbs\\_api & A novel                                                                         &  NA &   0\\\\\n",

I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, \"Oh, why can't you remain like this for ever!\" This was all that passed between them on the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up.

The integration layer must transform to allow organizations to move boldly in building new customer experiences, rather than forcing models for architecture and development that pull away from maximizing the organization's productivity. Many organizations have started embracing agile application techniques, such as microservice architecture, and are now seeing the benefits of that shift. This approach complements and accelerates an enterprise's API strategy. Businesses should also seek to use this approach to modernize their existing integration and messaging infrastructure to achieve more effective ways to manage and operate their integration services in their private or public cloud. This IBM® Redbooks® publication explores the merits of what we refer to as agile integration; a container-based, decentralized, and microservice-aligned approach for integration solutions that meets the demands of agility, scalability, and resilience required by digital transformation. It also discusses how the IBM Cloud Pak for Integration marks a significant leap forward in integration technology by embracing both a cloud-native approach and container technology to achieve the goals of agile integration. The target audiences for this book are cloud integration architects, IT specialists, and application developers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         &  650 &                           &                                                                                                                 &                                                                                                                 & en & http://books.google.com/books?id=8upYzQEACAAJ\\&dq=search+terms\\&hl=\\&cd=952\\&source=gbs\\_api                     & http://books.google.com/books?id=8upYzQEACAAJ\\&dq=search+terms\\&hl=\\&source=gbs\\_api &                                                                                 &  NA &   0\\\\\n",

       "| 6 | L0rrrfE0bOsC | Deep Web Query Interface Understanding and Integration                      | Eduard C. Dragut, Weiyi Meng, Clement T. Yu                                                       | Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers      | 2012     | There are millions of searchable data sources on the Web and to a large extent their contents can only be reached through their own query interfaces. There is an enormous interest in making the data in these sources easily accessible. There are primarily two general approaches to achieve this objective. The first is to surface the contents of these sources from the deep Web and add the contents to the index of regular search engines. The second is to integrate the searching capabilities of these sources and support integrated access to them. In this book, we introduce the state-of-the-art techniques for extracting, understanding, and integrating the query interfaces of deep Web data sources. These techniques are critical for producing an integrated query interface for each domain. The interface serves as the mediator for searching all data sources in the concerned domain. While query interface integration is only relevant for the deep Web integration approach, the extraction and understanding of query interfaces are critical for both deep Web exploration approaches. This book aims to provide in-depth and comprehensive coverage of the key technologies needed to create high quality integrated query interfaces automatically. The following technical issues are discussed in detail in this book: query interface modeling, query interface extraction, query interface clustering, query interface matching, query interface attribute integration, and query interface integration.

Now in its second edition, Sara Knapp has updated and expanded this invaluable resource. Unlike any other thesaurus available, this popular guide offers a wealth of natural language options in a convenient, A-to-Z format. It's ideal for helping users find the appropriate word or words for computer searches in the humanities, social sciences, and business.

Shipley, Art Bowker                                                                       | Newnes                            | 11/12/13 | Written by experts on the frontlines, Investigating Internet Crimes provides seasoned and new investigators with the background and tools they need to investigate crime occurring in the online world. This invaluable guide provides step-by-step instructions for investigating Internet crimes, including locating, interpreting, understanding, collecting, and documenting online electronic evidence to benefit investigations. Cybercrime is the fastest growing area of crime as more criminals seek to exploit the speed, convenience and anonymity that the Internet provides to commit a diverse range of criminal activities. Today's online crime includes attacks against computer data and systems, identity theft, distribution of child pornography, penetration of online financial services, using social networks to commit crimes, and the deployment of viruses, botnets, and email scams such as phishing. Symantec's 2012 Norton Cybercrime Report stated that the world spent an estimated $110 billion to combat cybercrime, an average of nearly $200 per victim. Law enforcement agencies and corporate security officers around the world with the responsibility for enforcing, investigating and prosecuting cybercrime are overwhelmed, not only by the sheer number of crimes being committed but by a lack of adequate training material. This book provides that fundamental knowledge, including how to properly collect and document online evidence, trace IP addresses, and work undercover.

Bhowmick, Byron Choi                                                                    | Springer Nature                   | 4/17/23  | This book details recent developments in the emerging area of plug-and-play (PnP) visual subgraph query interfaces (VQI). These PnP interfaces are grounded in the principles of human-computer interaction (HCI) and cognitive psychology to address long-standing limitations to bottom-up search capabilities in graph databases using traditional graph query languages, which often require domain experts and specialist programmers. This book explains how PnP interfaces go against the traditional mantra of VQI construction by taking a data-driven approach and giving end users the freedom to easily and quickly construct and maintain a VQI for any data sources without resorting to coding. The book walks readers through the intuitive PnP interface that uses templates where the underlying graph repository represents the socket and user-specified requirements represent the plug. Hence, a PnP interface enables an end user to change the socket (i.e., graph repository) or the plug (i.e., requirements) as necessary to automatically and effortlessly generate VQIs. The book argues that such a data-driven paradigm creates several benefits, including superior support for visual subgraph query construction, significant reduction in the manual cost of constructing and maintaining a VQI for any graph data source, and portability of the interface across diverse sources and querying applications. This book provides a comprehensive introduction to the notion of PnP interfaces, compares it to its classical manual counterpart, and reviews techniques for automatic construction and maintenance of these new interfaces. In synthesizing current research on plug-and-play visual subgraph query interface management, this book gives readers a snapshot of the state of the art in this topic as well as future research directions.                                                                                                                                          |  182 | Computers                                 | http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6nWzEAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api | http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6nWzEAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=1&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api | en | http://books.google.com/books?id=6nWzEAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=search+terms&amp;hl=&amp;cd=17&amp;source=gbs_api              | https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6nWzEAAAQBAJ&amp;source=gbs_api       | <!----> | NA | 0 |\n",

Clear, accessible explanations present reading concepts without oversimplifying the process of reading comprehension. To ensure students' understanding, reading keys or summaries follow the explanations, breaking them down into manageable chunks. Throughout each chapter, a variety of steadily more difficult exercises assess students' understanding of the material and promote improved comprehension and critical-thinking skills. This incremental approach to instruction and assessment makes it easier for beginning readers to absorb and master new information. The Fourth Edition includes new chapters on analyzing arguments and sentence relationships. In addition, there is a greater emphasis on recognizing and understanding verbal clues to meaning, new discussions on how the brain learns and remembers new information, and several new engaging readings.

From search strings that will reveal secret documents from South Africa ( filetype: xls site: za confidential ) to tracking down tables of Russian passwords ( filetype: xls site: ru login ), this is both an instructive and voyeuristic look at how the most powerful spy agency in the world uses Google.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |  650 | Computer network resources                | http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qLzoWKp2JHcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api | http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qLzoWKp2JHcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=1&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api | en | http://books.google.com/books?id=qLzoWKp2JHcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=search+terms&amp;hl=&amp;cd=20&amp;source=gbs_api | http://books.google.com/books?id=qLzoWKp2JHcC&amp;dq=search+terms&amp;hl=&amp;source=gbs_api | The NSA's Guide to Gathering Information on Google                                           |  1 | 1 |\n",

Then try this super-duper colossal collection of 365 searches—a full year’s worth of mind-melting puzzles that will (as a bonus) improve your vocabulary, too. Every page has TWO word searches on it, each with a cool theme, like \"File Extensions\" and \"Fountains\" or \"Jelly Beans\" and \"Letter Order.\" See how many \"Movie Stars\" (Damon, Diesel, Streep) catch your eye or fun \"Onomatopoeia\" words you can circle—boom, buzz, clang, click, gurgle, hiccup, honk. Experts who want something really challenging will find what they want here, too. \"Conifer\" includes such tree names as bristlecone, loblolly, and tamarack, while \"Quantum Mechanics\" offers bosons, fermions, and isobar. And for something a little unusual, there’s even a \"Minnesota Zip Code\" puzzle, where you look for groups of numbers. But the truly brain-busting ones come at the end of the book, when the puzzles veer from the standard to the really challenging, and some even have no word list at all. They’re hard, they’re tough . . . and they’re wildly entertaining!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |    0 | Games &amp; Activities                        | http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AuFKEAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;source=gbs_api           | http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AuFKEAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=1&amp;source=gbs_api           | en | http://books.google.com/books?id=AuFKEAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=search+terms&amp;hl=&amp;cd=24&amp;source=gbs_api                     | http://books.google.com/books?id=AuFKEAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=search+terms&amp;hl=&amp;source=gbs_api | 365 Great Puzzles                                                                            | NA | 0 |\n",

It tells the story of the impact of one of the most significant technological breakthroughs in Japan in the latter part of this century: the invention and rapid adoption of word-processing technology capable of handling Japanese script in a society where the nature of that script had previously mandated handwriting as the norm. The ramifications of this technology in both the business and personal spheres have been wide-ranging, extending from changes to business practices, work profiles, orthography and social attitudes to writing through to Japan's ability to construct a substantial presence on the Internet in recent years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |  219 | Social Science                            | http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SYEnAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api | http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SYEnAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=1&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api | en | http://books.google.com/books?id=SYEnAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=search+terms&amp;hl=&amp;cd=25&amp;source=gbs_api             | https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SYEnAAAAQBAJ&amp;source=gbs_api       | Kanji and the Keyboard                                                                       | NA | 0 |\n",

Since users are only intermittently connected to MSNets, user mobility should be exploited to bridge network partitions and forward data. Currently, data route/forward approaches for such intermittently connected networks are commonly \"store-carry-and-forward\" schemes, which exploit the physical user movements to carry data around the network and overcome path disconnection. And since the source and destination may be far away from each other, the delay for the destination to receive the data from the source may be long. MSNets can be viewed as one type of socially-aware delay tolerant networks (DTNs). Observed from social networks, the contact frequencies are probably different between two friends and two strangers, and this difference should be taken into consideration when designing data dissemination and query schemes in MSNets. In this book, the fundamental concepts of MSNets are introduced including the background, key features and potential applications of MSNets, while also presenting research topics, such as, MSNets as realistic social contact traces and user mobility models. Because the ultimate goal is to establish networks that allow mobile users to quickly and efficiently access interesting information, particular attention is paid to data dissemination and query schemes in subsequent sections. Combined with geography information, the concepts of community and centrality are employed from a social network perspective to propose several data dissemination and query schemes, and further use real social contact traces to evaluate their performance, demonstrating that such schemes achieve better performance when exploiting more social relationships between users. |   86 | Computers                                 | http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VQSikiO8IA0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api | http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VQSikiO8IA0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=1&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api | en | http://books.google.com/books?id=VQSikiO8IA0C&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=search+terms&amp;hl=&amp;cd=26&amp;source=gbs_api             | https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VQSikiO8IA0C&amp;source=gbs_api       | <!----> | NA | 0 |\n",

In three new short e-books, Melanie Mitchell takes you to the cutting edge of search engine optimization (SEO), demonstrating how to use powerful new techniques to achieve unprecedented results! In SEO &amp; PPC: Better Together, Mitchell transcends the debate between SEO and pay-per-click, showing how to use them both together to achieve better results than either can deliver alone. You’ll learn how to integrate SEO and PPC in campaigns that engage more consumers than ever before and use data from both to improve the performance of each. Next, How to Make SEO Work for You completely demystifies SEO, showing you how to grab value from “low hanging fruit” and start optimizing everything from pages, text, and keywords to images–even your page’s underlying HTML code. Mitchell shows how to craft a strategy that reflects your specific goals for attracting qualified traffic; measure everything from the quality of visitor engagement to sales conversions; structure sites that are friendlier to both searchers and search engines; earn the honest links that search algorithms love; and much more. Finally, in Unleash the Power of Paid Search, Mitchell brings together the processes, knowledge, and tools you need to build and manage exceptionally successful paid search campaigns. Mitchell guides you through the entire process of building and executing a winning campaign: defining goals and objectives, selecting keywords and match types, structuring accounts, scoring quality, managing ad copy, optimizing landing pages, monitoring, reporting, and more. These eBooks draw on Mitchell’s immense “in-the -trenches” experience to illuminate concepts, terminology, and best practices you need now, whether you’re “doing it yourself” or working with specialists.                                                                                                              |   95 | Business &amp; Economics                      | http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xXom9korRs4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api | http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xXom9korRs4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=1&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api | en | http://books.google.com/books?id=xXom9korRs4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=search+terms&amp;hl=&amp;cd=29&amp;source=gbs_api | http://books.google.com/books?id=xXom9korRs4C&amp;dq=search+terms&amp;hl=&amp;source=gbs_api | Expert Advice from Melanie Mitchell (Collection)                                             |  2 | 1 |\n",

But the hostage she randomly chose from the crowd to aid her isn't one of the emperor's men--not anymore. He's the former heir to the throne, who is now leading a rebellion against it. Rayce is a wanted man and dangerously charismatic, the worst person for Rose to get involved with, no matter what his smile promises. But he assumes Rose's attempt to take him hostage is part of a plot to crush the rebellion, so he takes her ashis hostage. Now Rose must prove where her loyalties lie, and she offers Rayce a deal--if he helps her rescue the other girls, she'll tell him all the Garden's secrets. Except the one secret she's kept for seven years that she'll to take to her grave if she must.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |  370 | Young Adult Fiction       | http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZPJMAQAACAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;source=gbs_api           | http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZPJMAQAACAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=1&amp;source=gbs_api           | en | http://books.google.com/books?id=ZPJMAQAACAAJ&amp;dq=search+terms&amp;hl=&amp;cd=934&amp;source=gbs_api                     | http://books.google.com/books?id=ZPJMAQAACAAJ&amp;dq=search+terms&amp;hl=&amp;source=gbs_api | <!----> |  NA |   0 |\n",

He's been practicing all summer and can't wait to see his classmates' faces when he beats them all. But on the first day of school, a new girl boldly crosses over to the boys' side and outruns everyone. That's not a very promising beginning for a friendship, but Jess and Leslie Burke become inseparable. Together they create Terabithia, a magical kingdom in the woods where the two of them reign as king and queen, and their imaginations set the only limits. Then one morning a terrible tragedy occurs. Only when Jess is able to come to grips with this tragedy does he finally understand the strength and courage Leslie has given him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |  212 | Juvenile Fiction          | http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LgLT04F1KscC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api | http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LgLT04F1KscC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=1&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api | en | http://books.google.com/books?id=LgLT04F1KscC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=search+terms&amp;hl=&amp;cd=938&amp;source=gbs_api | http://books.google.com/books?id=LgLT04F1KscC&amp;dq=search+terms&amp;hl=&amp;source=gbs_api | <!----> | 4.0 | 282 |\n",

Today, more than a million books later, he has accomplished what has been called “the greatest cultural rescue effort in Jewish history.” In Outwitting History, Lansky shares his adventures as well as the poignant and often laugh-out-loud stories he heard as he traveled the country collecting books. Introducing us to a dazzling array of writers, he shows us how an almost-lost culture is the bridge between the old world and the future—and how the written word can unite everyone who believes in the power of great literature.

In the run-up to the 2016 election, Owen Callahan, an aspiring writer, moves back to Kentucky to live with his Trump-supporting uncle and grandfather. Eager to clean up his act after wasting time and potential in his early twenties, he takes a job as a groundskeeper at a small local college, in exchange for which he is permitted to take a writing course. Here he meets Alma Hazdic, a writer in residence who seems to have everything that Owen lacks—a prestigious position, an Ivy League education, success as a writer. They begin a secret relationship, and as they grow closer, Alma—who comes from a liberal family of Bosnian immigrants—struggles to understand Owen’s fraught relationship with family and home. Exquisitely written; expertly crafted; dazzling in its precision, restraint, and depth of feeling, Groundskeeping is a novel of haunting power and grace from a prodigiously gifted young writer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |  337 | Fiction                   | http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PvaUEAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;source=gbs_api           | http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PvaUEAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=1&amp;source=gbs_api           | en | http://books.google.com/books?id=PvaUEAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=search+terms&amp;hl=&amp;cd=946&amp;source=gbs_api              | http://books.google.com/books?id=PvaUEAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=search+terms&amp;hl=&amp;source=gbs_api | A novel                                                                         |  NA |   0 |\n",

They soon know that they will grow up, and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother. I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, \"Oh, why can't you remain like this for ever!\" This was all that passed between them on the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always know after you are two.

The integration layer must transform to allow organizations to move boldly in building new customer experiences, rather than forcing models for architecture and development that pull away from maximizing the organization's productivity. Many organizations have started embracing agile application techniques, such as microservice architecture, and are now seeing the benefits of that shift. This approach complements and accelerates an enterprise's API strategy. Businesses should also seek to use this approach to modernize their existing integration and messaging infrastructure to achieve more effective ways to manage and operate their integration services in their private or public cloud. This IBM® Redbooks® publication explores the merits of what we refer to as agile integration; a container-based, decentralized, and microservice-aligned approach for integration solutions that meets the demands of agility, scalability, and resilience required by digital transformation. It also discusses how the IBM Cloud Pak for Integration marks a significant leap forward in integration technology by embracing both a cloud-native approach and container technology to achieve the goals of agile integration. The target audiences for this book are cloud integration architects, IT specialists, and application developers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |  650 | <!----> | <!----> | <!----> | en | http://books.google.com/books?id=8upYzQEACAAJ&amp;dq=search+terms&amp;hl=&amp;cd=952&amp;source=gbs_api                     | http://books.google.com/books?id=8upYzQEACAAJ&amp;dq=search+terms&amp;hl=&amp;source=gbs_api | <!----> |  NA |   0 |\n",

       "2   This volume constitutes the Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Flexible Query Answering Systems, FQAS 2009, held in Roskilde, Denmark, October 26–28, 2009. FQAS 2009 was preceded by the 1994, 1996 and 1998 editions held in Roskilde, Denmark, the FQAS 2000 held in Warsaw, Poland, the 2002 held in Copenhagen, Denmark, and the 2004 and 2006 editions held in Lyon, France, and in Milan, Italy, respectively. FQAS is the premier conference concerned with the very important issue of providing users of information systems with ?exible querying capabilities, and withaneasyandintuitiveaccesstoinformation.Themainobjectiveistoachieve more expressive, informative, cooperative, and productive systems which faci- tate retrieval from information repositories such as databases, libraries, hete- geneous archives and the World-Wide Web.

       "6   There are millions of searchable data sources on the Web and to a large extent their contents can only be reached through their own query interfaces. There is an enormous interest in making the data in these sources easily accessible. There are primarily two general approaches to achieve this objective. The first is to surface the contents of these sources from the deep Web and add the contents to the index of regular search engines. The second is to integrate the searching capabilities of these sources and support integrated access to them. In this book, we introduce the state-of-the-art techniques for extracting, understanding, and integrating the query interfaces of deep Web data sources. These techniques are critical for producing an integrated query interface for each domain. The interface serves as the mediator for searching all data sources in the concerned domain. While query interface integration is only relevant for the deep Web integration approach, the extraction and understanding of query interfaces are critical for both deep Web exploration approaches. This book aims to provide in-depth and comprehensive coverage of the key technologies needed to create high quality integrated query interfaces automatically. The following technical issues are discussed in detail in this book: query interface modeling, query interface extraction, query interface clustering, query interface matching, query interface attribute integration, and query interface integration.

Now in its second edition, Sara Knapp has updated and expanded this invaluable resource. Unlike any other thesaurus available, this popular guide offers a wealth of natural language options in a convenient, A-to-Z format. It's ideal for helping users find the appropriate word or words for computer searches in the humanities, social sciences, and business.

This invaluable guide provides step-by-step instructions for investigating Internet crimes, including locating, interpreting, understanding, collecting, and documenting online electronic evidence to benefit investigations. Cybercrime is the fastest growing area of crime as more criminals seek to exploit the speed, convenience and anonymity that the Internet provides to commit a diverse range of criminal activities. Today's online crime includes attacks against computer data and systems, identity theft, distribution of child pornography, penetration of online financial services, using social networks to commit crimes, and the deployment of viruses, botnets, and email scams such as phishing.

Law enforcement agencies and corporate security officers around the world with the responsibility for enforcing, investigating and prosecuting cybercrime are overwhelmed, not only by the sheer number of crimes being committed but by a lack of adequate training material.

       "17  This book details recent developments in the emerging area of plug-and-play (PnP) visual subgraph query interfaces (VQI). These PnP interfaces are grounded in the principles of human-computer interaction (HCI) and cognitive psychology to address long-standing limitations to bottom-up search capabilities in graph databases using traditional graph query languages, which often require domain experts and specialist programmers. This book explains how PnP interfaces go against the traditional mantra of VQI construction by taking a data-driven approach and giving end users the freedom to easily and quickly construct and maintain a VQI for any data sources without resorting to coding. The book walks readers through the intuitive PnP interface that uses templates where the underlying graph repository represents the socket and user-specified requirements represent the plug. Hence, a PnP interface enables an end user to change the socket (i.e., graph repository) or the plug (i.e., requirements) as necessary to automatically and effortlessly generate VQIs. The book argues that such a data-driven paradigm creates several benefits, including superior support for visual subgraph query construction, significant reduction in the manual cost of constructing and maintaining a VQI for any graph data source, and portability of the interface across diverse sources and querying applications. This book provides a comprehensive introduction to the notion of PnP interfaces, compares it to its classical manual counterpart, and reviews techniques for automatic construction and maintenance of these new interfaces. In synthesizing current research on plug-and-play visual subgraph query interface management, this book gives readers a snapshot of the state of the art in this topic as well as future research directions.                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "19  READING KEYS - the first in a three-book reading series by Laraine Flemming - offers a comprehensive introduction to reading skills and strategies, from using context clues to identifying purpose and bias. Clear, accessible explanations present reading concepts without oversimplifying the process of reading comprehension. To ensure students' understanding, reading keys or summaries follow the explanations, breaking them down into manageable chunks. Throughout each chapter, a variety of steadily more difficult exercises assess students' understanding of the material and promote improved comprehension and critical-thinking skills. This incremental approach to instruction and assessment makes it easier for beginning readers to absorb and master new information. The Fourth Edition includes new chapters on analyzing arguments and sentence relationships. In addition, there is a greater emphasis on recognizing and understanding verbal clues to meaning, new discussions on how the brain learns and remembers new information, and several new engaging readings.

This quote from the authors hints at the investigative power of the techniques this book teaches: Nothing I am going to describe to you is illegal, nor does it in any way involve accessing unauthorized data, [...but] involves using publicly available search engines to access publicly available information that almost certainly was not intended for public distribution. From search strings that will reveal secret documents from South Africa ( filetype: xls site: za confidential ) to tracking down tables of Russian passwords ( filetype: xls site: ru login ), this is both an instructive and voyeuristic look at how the most powerful spy agency in the world uses Google.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "24  Love word searches? Then try this super-duper colossal collection of 365 searches—a full year’s worth of mind-melting puzzles that will (as a bonus) improve your vocabulary, too. Every page has TWO word searches on it, each with a cool theme, like \"File Extensions\" and \"Fountains\" or \"Jelly Beans\" and \"Letter Order.\" See how many \"Movie Stars\" (Damon, Diesel, Streep) catch your eye or fun \"Onomatopoeia\" words you can circle—boom, buzz, clang, click, gurgle, hiccup, honk. Experts who want something really challenging will find what they want here, too. \"Conifer\" includes such tree names as bristlecone, loblolly, and tamarack, while \"Quantum Mechanics\" offers bosons, fermions, and isobar. And for something a little unusual, there’s even a \"Minnesota Zip Code\" puzzle, where you look for groups of numbers. But the truly brain-busting ones come at the end of the book, when the puzzles veer from the standard to the really challenging, and some even have no word list at all. They’re hard, they’re tough . . . and they’re wildly entertaining!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "25  This book deals with a topical issue relating to the use of script in Japan, one which has the potential to reshape future script policy through the mediation of both orthographic practices and social relations. It tells the story of the impact of one of the most significant technological breakthroughs in Japan in the latter part of this century: the invention and rapid adoption of word-processing technology capable of handling Japanese script in a society where the nature of that script had previously mandated handwriting as the norm. The ramifications of this technology in both the business and personal spheres have been wide-ranging, extending from changes to business practices, work profiles, orthography and social attitudes to writing through to Japan's ability to construct a substantial presence on the Internet in recent years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "26  With the increasing popularization of personal hand-held mobile devices, more people use them to establish network connectivity and to query and share data among themselves in the absence of network infrastructure, creating mobile social networks (MSNet). Since users are only intermittently connected to MSNets, user mobility should be exploited to bridge network partitions and forward data. Currently, data route/forward approaches for such intermittently connected networks are commonly \"store-carry-and-forward\" schemes, which exploit the physical user movements to carry data around the network and overcome path disconnection. And since the source and destination may be far away from each other, the delay for the destination to receive the data from the source may be long. MSNets can be viewed as one type of socially-aware delay tolerant networks (DTNs). Observed from social networks, the contact frequencies are probably different between two friends and two strangers, and this difference should be taken into consideration when designing data dissemination and query schemes in MSNets. In this book, the fundamental concepts of MSNets are introduced including the background, key features and potential applications of MSNets, while also presenting research topics, such as, MSNets as realistic social contact traces and user mobility models. Because the ultimate goal is to establish networks that allow mobile users to quickly and efficiently access interesting information, particular attention is paid to data dissemination and query schemes in subsequent sections. Combined with geography information, the concepts of community and centrality are employed from a social network perspective to propose several data dissemination and query schemes, and further use real social contact traces to evaluate their performance, demonstrating that such schemes achieve better performance when exploiting more social relationships between users.\n",

       "934 After seven grueling years of captivity in the Garden--a burlesque troupe of slave girls--sixteen-year-old Rose finds an opportunity to escape during a performance for the emperor. But the hostage she randomly chose from the crowd to aid her isn't one of the emperor's men--not anymore. He's the former heir to the throne, who is now leading a rebellion against it. Rayce is a wanted man and dangerously charismatic, the worst person for Rose to get involved with, no matter what his smile promises. But he assumes Rose's attempt to take him hostage is part of a plot to crush the rebellion, so he takes her ashis hostage. Now Rose must prove where her loyalties lie, and she offers Rayce a deal--if he helps her rescue the other girls, she'll tell him all the Garden's secrets. Except the one secret she's kept for seven years that she'll to take to her grave if she must.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "938 Jess Aarons' greatest ambition is to be the fastest runner in his grade. He's been practicing all summer and can't wait to see his classmates' faces when he beats them all. But on the first day of school, a new girl boldly crosses over to the boys' side and outruns everyone. That's not a very promising beginning for a friendship, but Jess and Leslie Burke become inseparable. Together they create Terabithia, a magical kingdom in the woods where the two of them reign as king and queen, and their imaginations set the only limits. Then one morning a terrible tragedy occurs. Only when Jess is able to come to grips with this tragedy does he finally understand the strength and courage Leslie has given him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

Important.” —Library Journal, starred review “A marvelous yarn, loaded with near-calamitous adventures and characters as memorable as Singer creations.” —The New York Post “What began as a quixotic journey was also a picaresque romp, a detective story, a profound history lesson, and a poignant evocation of a bygone world.” —The Boston Globe “Every now and again a book with near-universal appeal comes along: Outwitting History is just such a book.” —The Sunday Oregonian As a twenty-three-year-old graduate student, Aaron Lansky set out to save the world’s abandoned Yiddish books before it was too late. Today, more than a million books later, he has accomplished what has been called “the greatest cultural rescue effort in Jewish history.” In Outwitting History, Lansky shares his adventures as well as the poignant and often laugh-out-loud stories he heard as he traveled the country collecting books. Introducing us to a dazzling array of writers, he shows us how an almost-lost culture is the bridge between the old world and the future—and how the written word can unite everyone who believes in the power of great literature.

       "946 A TODAY SHOW #ReadWithJenna BOOK CLUB PICK • An indelible love story about two very different people navigating the entanglements of class and identity and coming of age in an America coming apart at the seams—this is \"an extraordinary debut about the ties that bind families together and tear them apart across generations\" (Ann Patchett, best-selling author of The Dutch House). In the run-up to the 2016 election, Owen Callahan, an aspiring writer, moves back to Kentucky to live with his Trump-supporting uncle and grandfather. Eager to clean up his act after wasting time and potential in his early twenties, he takes a job as a groundskeeper at a small local college, in exchange for which he is permitted to take a writing course. Here he meets Alma Hazdic, a writer in residence who seems to have everything that Owen lacks—a prestigious position, an Ivy League education, success as a writer. They begin a secret relationship, and as they grow closer, Alma—who comes from a liberal family of Bosnian immigrants—struggles to understand Owen’s fraught relationship with family and home. Exquisitely written; expertly crafted; dazzling in its precision, restraint, and depth of feeling, Groundskeeping is a novel of haunting power and grace from a prodigiously gifted young writer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "951 All children, except one, grow up. They soon know that they will grow up, and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother. I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, \"Oh, why can't you remain like this for ever!\" This was all that passed between them on the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always know after you are two. Two is the beginning of the end.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "952 The organization pursuing digital transformation must embrace new ways to use and deploy integration technologies, so they can move quickly in a manner appropriate to the goals of multicloud, decentralization, and microservices. The integration layer must transform to allow organizations to move boldly in building new customer experiences, rather than forcing models for architecture and development that pull away from maximizing the organization's productivity. Many organizations have started embracing agile application techniques, such as microservice architecture, and are now seeing the benefits of that shift. This approach complements and accelerates an enterprise's API strategy. Businesses should also seek to use this approach to modernize their existing integration and messaging infrastructure to achieve more effective ways to manage and operate their integration services in their private or public cloud. This IBM® Redbooks® publication explores the merits of what we refer to as agile integration; a container-based, decentralized, and microservice-aligned approach for integration solutions that meets the demands of agility, scalability, and resilience required by digital transformation. It also discusses how the IBM Cloud Pak for Integration marks a significant leap forward in integration technology by embracing both a cloud-native approach and container technology to achieve the goals of agile integration. The target audiences for this book are cloud integration architects, IT specialists, and application developers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
